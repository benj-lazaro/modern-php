- In a health and nutrition application, you have an array of meals as follows:

    $meals = [
        ['name' => 'Chicken Salad', 'calories' => 350],
        ['name' => 'Grilled Salmon', 'calories' => 480],
        ['name' => 'Vegetable Stir Fry', 'calories' => 300]
    ]; 

    - And the following function calculateMealCalories defined 
        - To calculate and display the total calories of the array of meals.

    function calculateMealCalories($meals, $detailed = true) {
        $totalCalories = 0;
        foreach ($meals as $meal) {

            }
        }
        echo "Total calories: " . $totalCalories . ".<br>";
    }

Coding Exerise 22: Event Scheduler For Online Conferences Part 01
--------------------------------------------------------------
- You are part of a team organizing an international online conference
    - To ensure the event runs smoothly, it's crucial to schedule sessions 
        - At times that work across multiple time zones
        
    - Your task is to help create a scheduling tool that 
        - Calculates the best meeting times
        - Considering the diverse locations of all participants

    
- Tasks
    - Write two (2) specific functions
        - calculateTimeOverlap()
            - Accepts UTC time zone offets of two participants
            - Calculates the overlap in their preferred meeting time window
            - Suggest an optimal meeting time based on this data

        - suggestOptimalMeetingTime()
            - Utilizes the overlap calculated by calling the function calculateTimeOverlap()
            - To suggest a meeting time

    - Create a function named calculateTimeOverlap()
        - Accepts two (2) parameters namely "$offset1" and "$offset2"
            - These represents the timezone offsets from UTC for each participant

        - Calculates the intersection of working hours 
            - Between two (2) time zones based on their UTC offsets
                - Use 12:00 UTC as the baseline start time
                - Use 18:00 UTC as the baseline end time
            
            - Returns an array with
                - Start and end times of the overlap in UTC
                - Otherwise, returns an empty array

        - When calculating time overlaps
            - Assume ALL overlaps occur within the same day

    - Create a function named suggestOptimalMeetingTime()
        - Accepts two (2) parameters namely "$offset1" and "$offset2"
            - These represents the timezone offsets from UTC for each participant

        - Using the array returned by the function calculateTimeOverlap()
            - Suggest an optimal meeting time

            - If there is an overlap, output the message via "echo"

                "Suggested meeting time: [start] to [end] UTC"


            - If there is NO overlap, output the message via "echo"

                "No available meeting time for these time zones."


    - You write additional helper functions if this helps

    - NOTE: You are only required to write the function definitions
        - The invocation of these functions will be handled within the test

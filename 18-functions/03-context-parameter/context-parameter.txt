Function Contexts & Parameter Passing: Transfer Data Into Functions
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- When a function is called / invoked
    - It creates its own context
    
    - Declared variables within the function are
        - Completely SEPARATE from the outside 'world'
            - Even if a variable has an identical name outside the function

        - Values assigned to these variables
            - ONLY EXISTS within the function
        
    - Once the function completes its execution
        - The variables within the function are immediately discarded


- In order to pass values into a function requires
    - Declaring a parameter variable or list of parameter variables
        - Enclosed w/in the ( ) right after the function name
        - If multiple parameter variables, each is separated by a ','

    - Parameter variables are immediately discarded after
        - The function completes its execution

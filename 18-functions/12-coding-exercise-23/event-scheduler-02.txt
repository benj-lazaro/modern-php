Coding Exercise 23: Event Scheduler For Online Conferences Part 02
------------------------------------------------------------------
- Feel free to build on any code from the previous challenge


- Task:
    - Improve the scheduling tool to support multiple participants

    - Write two (2) functions as in the previous challenge
        - calculateTimeOverlap()
            - Now accepts an array of participants
            - Including their UTC time zone
            - Calculates the overlap in their preferred session time window

        - suggestOptimalMeetingTime()
            - Uses the overlap calculated by calculateTimeOverlap()
            - For all participants to suggest a meeting time

    - Partipants will now be represented in the following structure

        $participants = [
            ["Name" => "Max", "Timezone" => "UTC-3"],
            ["Name" => "Charlie", "Timezone" => "UTC+1"],
            ["Name" => "Alex", "Timezone" => "UTC+2"],
            ["Name" => "Nina", "Timezone" => "UTC"]
            ];

    - NOTE: The preferred window time remains
        - From 12:00 to 18:00 UTC

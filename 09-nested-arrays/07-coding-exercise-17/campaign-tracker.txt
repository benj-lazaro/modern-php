Coding Exercise 17: Marketing Campaign Tracker 01
-------------------------------------------------
- Analyze the effectiveness of digital advertising campaigns for an online retailer
    - Each campaign consists of
        - Multiple ad sets aimed at different customer segments
        - Offering insights into customer engagement 
        - Marketing strategy success


- Your analysis will focus on a simplified dataset structured as a PHP associative array
    - Detailing each campaign's name and its ad sets, each with a unique name


- Tasks:
    - Compile a list of all ad set names within their campaigns
        - Navigate through the dataset to list all ad set names
            - Organized by their campaigns
        
        - The output should clearly associate each ad set with its campaign
            - Using the following format

                [Campaign Name]: "[Name of AdSet1]", "[Name of AdSet2]"
                [Campaign Name]: "[Name of AdSet1]", "[Name of AdSet2]"

Coding Exercise 17: Marketing Campaign Tracker 03
-------------------------------------------------
- The final part of this coding exercise
    - The "$campaign" array has a new property "targetAudience"
        - Contains an array of audience segments targeted by each ad set

    - A new string variable "$specifiedAudience"
        - Contains the name of a specific target audience
        - It is used to identify the highest performing ad set 
            - For a particular audience segment


- Tasks
    - Find the highest campaign with the highest click-through rate (CTR)
        - Using the following formula

            CTR = (Total Clicks / Total Impressions) * 100

        - Calculate the CTR for each campaign
            - identify the campaign with the highest CTR
            - Assign the campaign name & CTR value to the array "$highestCTR"

            $highestCTR = [ 'Campaign Name' => CTR ]

        - NOTE: When dealing with potentially missing data (e.g. clicks or impressions)
            - Use the value of 0 as a default for clicks
            - Use the value of 1 as a default for impressions

    - Compile a unique list of target audiences
        - Traverse each ad set to accumulate a unique list of target audience
            - Across ALL campaigns

        - Save this information in an array with unique items named "$uniqueTargetAudience"

    - Identify the highest-performing ad for a specific target audience
        - With a given target audience in "$specifiedAudience"
            - Sift through the ad sets to find those targeting this audience

        - Compare their CTR values to unearth the ad set with a high CTR
            - Store its name in the Associative array "$adWithHighestCTRForAudience"

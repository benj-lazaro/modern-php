Deal With Irregular Data In Nested Arrays
-----------------------------------------
- Irregular data is a common problem when working with nested arrays


- To address this concern
    - If there is a means to access the said nested array
        - Set the targeted "key" with an empty array

    - Alternatively, use an "if" statement in conjunction with the function "empty()"
        - Check if the target "key" containing the nested array is NOT empty
        
        - If it is NOT empty
            - Using a nested "foreach" loop to access the nested data

        - If it is empty
            - PHP ignores and skips the nested array that does NOT exists

    - This prevents PHP from triggering a warning when accessing a non-existent "key"
        - Which by itself a common irregular data scenario

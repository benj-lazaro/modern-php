The "parent" & "self" Keywords: Precisely Reference Class Methods
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- Use the keyword "parent"
    - To specifically refer to a Method declared w/in a Parent Class
    
    - Use the syntax:

        parent::<parent_class_method>();


- Use the keyword "this"
    - To refer to a Method based on the resolution 
        - Where the object that called the Method instantiated from (e.g. Parent / Child Class)
    
    - Use the syntax:

        this-><class_method>();


- Use the keyword "self"
    - To refer to a Method declared w/in the Class that an Object is instantiated from

    - Skips the resolution
        - Immediately executes the declared Method w/in the Class that an Object came from
        - Despite the possibility of the same Method being overriden in another Child Class

    - Use the syntax:

        self::<class_method>();

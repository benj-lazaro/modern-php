Property Visibility: Private And Protected Properties For Secure Data Handling
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The visibility keyword "private" prevents a Class Property
    - To be accessed by its instantiated object
    - To be shared with (or inherited by) its Child Class


- The visibility keyword "protected" prevents a Class Property
    - To be accessed by its instantiated object
    - HOWEVER, it can be shared (or inherited by) its Child Class


- NOTE: These visibility keywords are also applicable to Class Methods

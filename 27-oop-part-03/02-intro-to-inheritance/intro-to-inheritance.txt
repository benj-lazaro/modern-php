Intro To Inheritance: Extend Functionality From Parent Class
------------------------------------------------------------
- For a Child Class to inherit methods & properties of a Parent Class 
    - Use the keywrod "extends" 
    - Followed by the name of the Parent Class
    
Syntax:

class <child_class_name> extends <parent_class_name> {
    // Properties
    ...

    // Methods
    ...
}


- To override an inherited Method from a Parent Class
    - On PHP version 8.3 (and higher)
        - Use the annotation "#[\Override]"
        - Placed on TOP of the inherited Method  within the Child Class
        - Otherwise, triggers a Fatal error

    - On PHP version 8.2 (and lower)
        - The annotation "#[\Override]" has NO effect
            - PHP treats it as a comment
        
        - To override, simply declare a Method using 
            - The same delared Method name in the Parent Class
        
Syntax:

class <child_class_name> extends <parent_class_name> {
    // Properties
    ...

    // Override inherited Method in PHP 8.3
    #[\Override]
    public function <inherited_method_name>() {
        ...
    }

    // Override inherited Method in PHP 8.2
    public function <inherited_method_name>() {
        ...
    }
}

Code Exercise 29: E-Commerce Products Modeling 01
-------------------------------------------------
- You're tasked with enhancing an online store's system
    - Focusing on categorizing products like electronics and clothing 
    - With specific attributes and functionality

    - Your objective is to implement features that 
        - Accurately reflect each item's details, apply discounts, and update prices

    - You are given the base Class "Product" 
        - As the starting point for this exercise


- Tasks:
    - Define & implement the Class "Electronics"

    - Define & implement the Class "Clothing"

    - Enhance the Class "Product" with new Methods
        - getPrice()        = returns the current price of a product
        - updatePrice()     = accepts new price (float) & updates the Property "price"
        - applyDiscount()   = accepts a discount percentage (float), calculates & updates the Property "price"

    - NOTE: Due to Udemy's PHP 7.4
        - Avoid type declaration for Class Properties
        - However, enforcing types w/in Constructors & Methods is OK

Show The Background
-------------------
- Implement background images of the web app
    - Create a new folder named "images"
        - Within the root folder of the project

    - From the starter files
        - Take all of the sub-folders containing .svg files from the folder "00 - Design/SVGs/"

        - Copy them over to the folder "images"

    
- In the "index.php"
    - Assign a background image on the HTML element <div> with 
        - The HTML attribute "class" of "app-container"

    - Using the HTML attribute "style"
        - Assign the value "background-image: url('images/<image_folder>/<image_file>.svg')"

    - The property "background-image" can easily be changed / updated by PHP

    - Save the changes
        - Background image is 'zoomed in'


- Scale down the background image
    - By default, a .svg file has a viewport settings
        - It has a width & height that CSS respects

    - To address this concern
        - Open "styles.css"

        - On the class selector ".app-container"

        - Add a new property "background-size"
            - Assign the value "cover"
        
        - Add a new property "background-position"
            - Assign the value "bottom center"

        - Add a new property "background-color"
            - Assign the value "rgb(71, 174, 234)"
            - NOTE: serves as a contigency when a background image fails to load


- The top margin of the HTML element <div>
    - Has the tendency to have a computed negative value 
        - Resulting to an overflow at the element's top margin

    - To address this concern
        - On the class selector ".app-container"

        - Change the assigned value to the property "margin-top"
            - Cut the earlier "calc(...)" expression

        - Replace it with a "max()"
            - 1st argument value is "0px"
            - 2nd argument value, paste the "calc(...)" expression

        - Forces the "margin-top" with the value of "0px"
            - In the event that the "calc()" expression return a negative value
            - Preventing an overflow

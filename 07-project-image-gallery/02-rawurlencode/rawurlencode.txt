The rawurlencode Function: Ensure Safe Data Transmission
--------------------------------------------------------
- The PHP function "rawurlencode()"
    - Encodes a given string (i.e. URL) according to the RFC 3986
        - RFC 3986 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Generic Syntax
        - Reference (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986)

    - Returns a string which
        - All non-alphanumeric characters
            - Except for "-", "_", "." and "~"
            - Have been replaced with a "%" followed by two (2) hexadecimal digits
            - e.g. whitespace = %20, ? = %3F

        - Protects literal characters 
            - From being interpreter as special delimiters 
        
        - Protects URLs from being mangled by 
            - Transmission media with character conversions (e.g. email systems)

    - Use case
        - Working with filenames (path NOT included) that
            - Maybe embedded with characters which can lead to misintepretation
                - Resulting to unable to be read / loaded by the browser

            - Replaced with URL safe characters

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.rawurlencode.php)

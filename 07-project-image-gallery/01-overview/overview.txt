Overview And Code Walkthrough   
-----------------------------
- This section focuses on:
    - A project exercise to create an interactive image gallery            
    
    - It's body consists of a 3 columned image thumbnail
        - With a title for each image 
            
    - Clickable image thumbnail & title when clicked
        - Displays the full image with the title on top
        - A brief description of the image below it
        - A link "Back to gallery" to return to the main page

    - It heavily utilizes two (2) pre-defined Associative arrays that
        - Allows the web app to be flexible as possible
        - Allowing further images to be added at a later time


- On the project's starter files
    - The "gallery.php" file
        - Houses the gallery itself (the main page)

        - Implement the code in-between the two (2) "include" statements
            - That calls the "header.php" and "footer.php" files

    - The "header.php" and "footer.php" files
        - Holds the pre-built header and footer section of the gallery
        - Included from the "gallery.php" file

    - The "image.php" file
        - Accepts a $_GET parameter named "image"
        - Then shows the actual image

    - The "functions.inc.php" file
        - Contains the user-defined function "e"
            - That sanitizes user-generated input & output

    - The "images.inc.php" file
        - Contains the Associative arrays
            - Holds the filename and corresponding image title
            - Holds the filename and corresponding image description content

        - Associative arrays serves as a data source
            - For the images displayed in the "gallery.php" file
            - For each image & description in the "image.php" file

        - NOTE: The description contains may an embedded "\n" that
            - Requires being converted to "<br />"
                - Using the PHP function "str_replace()"
                - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-replace.php)

    - The "./images/" directory
        - Holds the images of the project

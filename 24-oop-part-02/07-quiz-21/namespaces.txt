Quiz 21: Test Your Knowledge On Namespaces
------------------------------------------
- Why are namespaces used in PHP?
    - Answer: To enable the same Class name to be used in different parts of a program
        - Or in different program without causing a name collision, by isolating them


- You aim to establish email notification functionality, comprising:

    /EmailService/NotificationSender.php - Intended to contain the NotificationSender class for sending email notifications

    - You're tasked with correctly defining the namespace for the NotificationSender class 
        - To ensure it is properly organized within the EmailService namespace

    - How should you begin the NotificationSender.php file to establish its namespace?

    - Answer: 

        namespace Emailservice;

        class NotificationSender {
            // Class implementation
        }


- Your PHP project has the following structure, designed to manage event registrations:

    src/
        EventManager.php
        /EmailService
            NotificationSender.php
        /LogService
            NotificationSender.php

    - /EmailService/NotificationSender.php defines 
        - A class named NotificationSender within the EmailService namespace 
        - For sending out email notifications.

    - Which of the following snippets in EventManager.php 
        - Will incorrectly attempt to instantiate the NotificationSender class 
        - From the EmailService namespace in your EventManager.php file?

    - Answer:

        require "EmailService/NotificationSender.php";
        use LogService\NotificationSender as EmailNotifier;
        $notifier = new EmailNotifier();


- What is the primary function of this code?

    function myAutoloader($className) {
        $path = "src/" . str_replace("\\", "/", $className) . ".php";
        if (file_exists($path)) {
            require $path;
        }
    }
    
    spl_autoload_register("myAutoloader");

    - Answer: Automatically includes Class files when a Class is used
        - Based on the class name & its namespace, mapping them to a path in the "src/" directory

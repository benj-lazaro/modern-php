Namespaces In PHP: Organize Code And Avoid Naming Collisions
------------------------------------------------------------
- Each Class name may ONLY EXIST ONCE
    - NO two identical Class name can co-exist in a PHP application
    
    - To address this concern is to use "Namespaces"
        - Prevents identically named Classes from colliding
        - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php)


- Best practice
    - If a Class file is in a Namespace
        - That Namespace gets turned into a folder structure
        - With the name of the folder is named after the Namespace

            - /src/Admin/User.php    = "Admin" is the Namespace of the Class file "User.php"
            - /src/Client/User.php   = "Client" is the Namespace of the Class file "User.php"
        
    - On each invidual Class file
        - Declare the Namespace at the first line of code (right after <?php)

            namespace <name>;
            
    - On the calling PHP program
        - Use "require" to include the Class files with identical names


- When instantiating an Object from a Class that is in a Namespace
    - Include the Namespace with the Class name; separated by a "\"
    - e.g. $admin = new Admin\User();
           $client = new Client\User();

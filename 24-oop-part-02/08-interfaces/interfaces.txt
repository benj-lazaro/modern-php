Interfaces: Define And Implement For Enhanced Type Safety And Reusability
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- An Interface is similar to that of a Class EXCEPT
    - It does NOT contain the implementations of a Class

    - It contains declaration of public Method(s) ONLY
        - Does NOT have its own implementation
        - e.g. public function <method_name>(); 

    - The actual implementation of the declared Method w/in an Interface
        - It is done w/in the Class that "implements" the declared Interface 
        - Thus, making its own Class Method implementation

        - e.g. class <class_name> implements <interface_name> {
                    .. 
                    public function <method_name>() {
                        ...
                    }
                }

    - NOTE: The argument(s) & return type of a Method w/in a Class that "implements" the Interface
        - MUST MATCH the argument(s) & return type of the Method declared in the Interface

    - It serves as a declaration that certain method(s) w/in a Class are expected to exists
        - Helps create reusable code

        
Syntax:

interface <interface_name> {
    public function <method_name>();
}

class <class_name> implements <interface_name> {
    public function <method_name> {
        ...
    }
}


- Use case:
    - A user-defined function that accepts an object as argument value
        - ONLY if the object is instantiated from a Class that "implements" an Interface 

        - Uses the Interface name as data type
            - For the variable that stores the passed object as argument value

        - Good alternative to the manual declaration of acceptable Class names
            - Using the "|" operator on the user-defined function's parameter list

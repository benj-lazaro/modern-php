Autoloading: Load Classes And Manage Namespaces Efficiently
-----------------------------------------------------------
- The PHP function "spl_autoload_register()"
    - Registers a given function (as argument value) as "__autoload()" implementation
        - Returns a boolean "true" on success or "false" on failure

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.spl-autoload-register.php)

    - Pass the function (to-be-created) "autoload" as argument value
        - Calls the function automatically everytime the PHP script is run


- Create a function named "autoload()"
    - It accepts the name of a Class as argument

    - Checks if it an existing fully qualified name of a Class with Namespace
        - e.g. <namespace>//<class_name>

    - If it evaluates to "true"
        - Loads the Class using the "require" statement 
        - e.g. require __DIR__ . "/src/<namespace>/<class_name>.php";

    - This ONLY loads Classes that are required by the current codebase
        - Eliminates the need to load ALL Classes from their respective Namespaces

    - However, this approach requires
        - Lisitng ALL anticipated Classes & their respective Namespaces
        - That might be required by the current codebase


- An alternative approach (i.e. better)
    - Instead of a chained "if" statement

    - Reconstruct the filepath of the Class & its corresponding Namespace
        - Save it on a variable

    - Check if the Class file exists
        - Loads the Class file using the "require" statement

    - This approach offers clean & short code

    - However, be mindful if the host OS is case-sensitive on filenames
        - Case-sensitivity may cause a Class file NOT to be loaded

        - NOTE: This is an OS-specific issue
            - On Mac OS, it is NOT case-sensitive
            - On Linux, it is case-sensitive


- An Anonymous function is an unnamed function
    - Uses the PHP keyword "function"
    - No name is declare & immediately followed by a pair of ( )
    - Returned value from the function is saved in a variable
    - The variable is called like a named function (e.g. $<variable>();)

    - NOTE: Anonymous function declaration ends with a ;

Syntax:

// Anonymous function declaration
$<variable_name> = function() {
    ...
};

// Calls the Anonymous function
$<variable_name>();


- Another alternative approach (i.e. much better)
    - Instead of a named function registered with an __autoload() implementation
    
    - An Anonymous function is passed as argument
        - To the PHP function "spl_autoload_register()"

    - Body of the Anonymous function is written as an inline argument value

    - Offers a shorter codebase
        - It registers the Anonymous function as autoloading
        
        - Executes the Anonymous function
            - Check if the Class file exists
            - Loads the Class file using the "require" statement


- NOTE: This "autoloading" implementation is good for small applications
    - Developing bigger and complex applications
    - The PSR-4 autoloading standard is required

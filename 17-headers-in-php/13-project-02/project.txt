Project: Create A Custom Error Document Part 02
-----------------------------------------------
- Create a custom error web page that
    - Overrides the browser default error page

    - Previously crafted an error page by embedding the logic that
        - Crafts the custom HTTP Status Code inside another PHP file
        
    - For this lecture 
        - Crafting a custom error page as a stand-alone
    
    - Common use case is accessing a file that does NOT exists
        - Wherein the browser renders its own default (generic) error page
        - After it receives a HTTP Status Code 404


- To craft a custom error page for the Apache web server
    - Create a configuration file ".htaccess"
        - Save it inside the project folder
        - NOTE: ONLY applies to the project folder's file & sub-folders

    - Inside the file
        - Write the following configuration on a single line

            ErrorDocument 404 <url_custom_error_page.php>

        - The URL starts RIGHT AFTER the web server's hostname
            - (e.g. /modern-php/17-headers-in-php/13-project-02/code/notfound.php)

        - NOTE: Replace whitespace character in the URL with "%20"
            - To prevent an invalid syntax when the URL is decoded
            - Triggering a HTTP Status Code 500 (Internal Server Error)

    - NOTE: The Apache web server MIGHT be configured that
        - Prevents the ".htaccess" from working
        
        - Some web hosting services that implements this practice
            - Or require a complicated setup in order for the ".htaccess" to work

        - Web servers besides Apache may require a different setup
            - Best to check its corresponding documentation

    - Moving the project folder requires editing the path of
        - The custom error page (.php) & its corresponding stylesheet file (.css)

    - IMPORTANT: This process is ONLY intended for 
        - Replacing the default (generic) error page rendered by the browser
        - Provide a custom error page and nothing more

    - To redirect stuff in PHP besides a custom error page
        - PHP uses "mod_rewrite" module


- To ensure the consistency of the custom error page's stylesheet
    - When accessing non-existent nested sub-folders

    - When assigning the CSS stylesheet in the custom error page
        - Use the PHP function "pathinfo()"

        - Pass the "$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']" & "PATHINFO_DIRNAME"
            - As argument values

        - Followed by the CSS stylesheet

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="<?php echo pathinfo($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'], PATHINFO_DIRNAME); ?>/simple.css">

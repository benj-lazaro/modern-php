Content-Disposition And Content-Length Header: Implement File Downloads
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The Header "Content-Disposition" indicates whether content is
    - Displayed inline in the browser as a web page
    - Download as an attachment locally


- To download the content instead of rendering on the browser
    - Assign the value "attachment" to "Content-Disposition"

    - Assign the filename with extension of the content to the parameter "filename"

    - Use a ";" to separate "Content-Disposition" from the "filename"

        header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=<filename.ext>");

    - NOTE: If the content happens to be a large file
        - The browser will NOT show a progress bar as it downloads the content


- To address this concern
    - Use the Header "Content-Length"

    - Pass the file size of the content as value
        - Use the returned value of the PHP function "filesize()"

        header("Content-Length:" . filesize(<filename.ext>));

    - Displays a progress bar as it downloads the content

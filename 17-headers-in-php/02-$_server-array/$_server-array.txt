The $_Server Array: Gain Insights About The Server Running Your PHP Script
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The $_SERVER Associative array provides
    - Server and execution environment information

    - Contains information such as headers, paths & script locations
        - Entries provided by the web server

        - However, there is NO guarantee that every web server will provide any of these
            - Some servers may omit and provide additional information NOT listed
            - Dependent on how the web server (i.e. Apache HTTPd) is configured
        
        - MOST of these information are accounted in the RFC 3875 (Common Gateway Interface)
            - Reference (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3875)

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.server.php)


- The property "REMOTE_ADDR"
    - Returns the IP address of the site visitor's machine
    
    - NOTE: In a few countries (e.g. EU) the client's IP address 
        - Is considered sensitive private information
        - Requires to have substantial reason to log the whole IP address


- The property "PHP_SELF"
    - Returns a string that contains 
        - The relative path and filename of the currently executing PHP script
    
    - NOTE: Dangerous if misused
        - Treat the it as a user-generated content
        - Sanitize the output using the PHP function "htmlspecialchars()"


- The property "REQUEST_URI"
    - Returns a string that contains identical value as "PHP_SELF"

    - Difference
        - It is requested by the visitor's browser
        - Additional URL parameters will become part of the returned value

    - NOTE: NOT commonly used
        - On niche use cases that test the values of additional URL parameters


- The property "SCRIPT_NAME"
    - Returns a string that contains identical value as "PHP_SELF"

    - Difference
        - Accessing the PHP file as a directory or folder
            - With another file succeeding it 
            - (e.g. http://localhost/modern-php/17-headers-in-php/02-$_server-array/code/server.php/test)

        - PHP will NOT consider the PHP file as a URL parameter
            - Returns the relative path up to the currently executing script
            - Omits the succeeding file from the path
        
        - Returns the succeeding file as a value of the property "PATH_INFO"

    - NOTE: Applicable on use cases
        - That uses the executing PHP script as a directory or folder
        - Otherwise, use the property "PHP_SELF" instead


- The property "REQUEST_METHOD"
    - Returns a string that identifies the request method
        - Used to access the page (e.g. 'GET', 'POST')

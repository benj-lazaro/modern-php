HTTP Headers: Examine Server To Browser Communication
-----------------------------------------------------
- Focused on headers sent back by the server to the site vistor's browser


- When reloading a blank web page on a browser
    - The server receives a HTTP Requet Method "GET"

    - The server replies with Response Headers that contain the properties
        - "Connection"
            - Type of connection 
            - e.g. "Keep-Alive"

        - "Content-Length"
            - Length of the content
            - e.g. 0

        - "Content-Type"
            - Type of content
            - e.g. "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "image/jpeg"

        - "Date"
            - Day, date , time and timezone of the Response
            - e.g. "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 08:04:08 GMT"

        - "Keep-Alive"
            - Value on how long to keep the connection alive
            - e.g. "timeout=5, max=100"

        - "Server"
            - Information about the running web server
            - e.g. "Apache/2.4.58 (Unix) OpenSSL/1.1.1w PHP/8.2.12 mod_perl/2.0.12 Perl/v5.34.1"

        - "X-Powered-By"
            - Information about the running PHP version
            - e.g. "PHP/8.2.12"

    - NOTE: ALL of the presented properties are DEPENDENT on
        - How the web server is CONFIGURED
        - The type of content requested by the browser



- To send a customized Response Headers for a normal web page
    - Use the function "headers()"
    
    - Pass the Response Headers property "Content-Type" with the value of  "text/plain"
        - e.g. "Content-Type: text/plain"

    - The browser receives the Response Headers from the server 
        - Reads the "Content-Type" or MIME Type
        - Renders the web page as a text file


- The PHP function "readfile()"
    - Reads a file from the local filesystems and outputs a file

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.readfile.php)
    
    - It can be used to open an image file from a ".php" file
        - Immediately send the content back to the browser for rendering

        - Similar to the PHP function "file_get_contents()"
            - Except this requires saving the content to a variable first
            - Then calls the function "echo()" to render the content of the variable
            - It offers an added overhead

        - NOTE: All the browser CARES about is the Response Headers' "Content-Type" value
            - NOT necessarily the filename extension

Testing The Design With Random Data
-----------------------------------
- Implement a new Class that generates a random weather data
    - Named "RandomWeatherFetches"
        - Implements the Interface "WatherFetchesInterface"
    
    - Implements its own Method "fetch()"
        - Returns a "WeatherInfo" object
        - Containing random data instead of a static one (like in "FakeWeatherFetcher.php")

    - The purpose of this implementation is to
        - Further test the initial design of the app

    - NOTE: Enable "strict_types" to ensure consistency
        - With the data types of the object's "WeatherInfo" properties
        - Generates a Fatal error due to "Uncaught TypeError"
        - Reduces the chance of unforeseen or "difficult to debug" bugs

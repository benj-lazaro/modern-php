----------------------------
- Implement code that fetches data from a "fake" weather API
    - URL (https://downloads.codingcoursestv.eu/056%20-%20php/weather/weather.php)


- First, learn how to use PHP function "fsockopen()"
    - Allows to manually connect to a remote server & transfer data
    
    - It initiates a socket connection (i.e. virtual file)
        - To write data to the server
        - To read data from the server

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fsockopen.php)

    - Unlike curl which is 80% support by local PHP installations
        - The function "fsockopen()" is ALWAYS available

    - Does NOT care whethere the protocol used is HTTP, HTTPS or SSL
        - It is a general way of establishing a connection

Implementing The View Code
--------------------------
- Implement the backend code that renders the fetched data namely
    - City
    - Temperature
    - Weather type


- The data is saved on the variable "$info"
    - Render the fetched data into the view file "index.view.php"


- NOTE: Current project intentionally did NOT use a "render()" function
    - To keep the implmentation simple
    - As it only renders the data on a single page

Overview
--------
- This section focuses on
    - Implementation of the backend side (in PHP)

    - Fetching the weather data from a 3rd-party (fake) weather API
        - URL (https://downloads.codingcoursestv.eu/056%20-%20php/weather/weather.php?city+Los%20Angeles)  
    
    - Structure the backend code that 
        - Is NOT entirely dependent on the said API
        - It can easily adopt to other weather API service

    - Create own mock-up weather data first
        - Latter sections will access the 3rd-party (fake) weather API

Adding Error Handling
---------------------
- Implement error handling on "RemoteWeatherFetcher.php" in the event of
    - Server connection failure
    - Server fails to provide a content


- To address this concerns
    - Prefix PHP function "fsockopen()" with "@" to supress warnings

    - In the event that "$fp" returns a falsy value
        - Return a null

    - Refactor the return value of method "fetch()" to include a null value
        - Prefixing the method's return value "WeatherInfo" with a "?"

    - Refactor the method "fetch()" of the Interface "WeatherFetcherInterface"
        - Prefixing the method's return value "WeatherInfo" with a "?"

    - Refactor "index.php"
        - In the event that the variable "$info" is empty
        - Return an "echo()" statement
        - Then terminate the script with the function "die()"

    - In the event that the server returned NO weather data
        - Return a null
    
    - In the event that the server returned an incomplete weather data
        - Return a null

Limitations Of Procedural Approaches: Setting The Stage For OOP
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Modelling a bank account program without using OOP


- Limitations of working with procedural programming approach
    - A function does NOT have the means to verify 
        - If a valid argument value comes with the required properties
        - That the a function is meant to work on

    - Functions working with an array argument value
        - Require placing a "&" on the parameter variable

        - To directly update the value(s) of the origina array
            - NOT the implicit copy that is normal passed as argument value

        - Makes the change(s) permanent after leaving the function
            - NOTE: This is NOT normally done with an array

    - Also on functions working with arrays
        - The structure of the array argument value is assumed beforehand

        - To prevent from triggering a warning
            - When accessing non-existent array 'keys'
    
    - Chance of colliding function names are high
        - Identical function names intended for different set of data
            - Triggering a "Fatal Error: Cannot redeclare <function_name>

        - As prevention 
            - Requires tedius long function names

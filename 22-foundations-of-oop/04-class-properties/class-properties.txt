Properties In A Class: Typing, Initialization & Management
----------------------------------------------------------
- Declaring a class property's data type is optional
    - Considered best practice to declare the data type of each property
    - This helps PHP's type system to ENFORCE it


- A Class with uninitialized properties
    - When instantiated into an object
    - Object's properties will be assigned the value of "uninitialized"


- Accessing an Object's property with the value of "uninitialized"
    - Trggers a fatal error
    - A property MUST be initialized with value before accessing it


- When assigning a value of a different data type into an Object's property
    - If "strict_types" mode is NOT declared or ENABLED
        - PHP performs an implicit typecast on the assigned value

    - If "strict_types" mode is ENABLED
        - PHP triggers a fatal error
        - Workaround is to explicitly typecast the assigned value


- To override an asisgned value of an OBject's property
    - Simply assign a new value using the "=" operator


- To specify a defalut value on a Class' property
    - Place the "=" right after the property name
    - Followed by the default value to be assigned

    - NOTE: Works for simple Class properties
        - Those that stores a int or string

        - For complex Class property, require the use of a Constructor

Secure Class Properties: From Public To Private Access
------------------------------------------------------
- To secure Properties of a Class
    - Changing from "public" to "private"

    - Prevents a Class Property in a Class that is NOT by design
        - To be directly accessed and updated (i.e. set)

    - In doing so, a Property will now be ONLY ACCESSIBLE w/in a Class

    - Attempt to access a Private Property of a Class
        - Triggers a "Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Cannot access private property"

Quiz 20: Test Your Knowledge About Classes
------------------------------------------
- In the context of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP, which of the following statements is incorrect?
    - Answer: Methods are predefined functions w/in a class that and cannot access or modify the object's properties


- You want to define a class UserProfile with a single property username. 
    - Then you want to create an instance of UserProfile and save it to the variable $user
    - Which of the following code snippets correctly accomplishes the task?

    - Answer:

        class UserProfile
        {
            public string $username;
        }

        $user = new UserProfile();


- In the continued development of our UserProfile class
    - You decide to add a method that enables the retrieval of the user's username.

    - Below is the class with a crucial line missing in the method. 
        - Your task is to identify the missing line, ensuring the method works as intended.


            class UserProfile {
                public string $username;
            
                function getUsername() {
                    // missing line
                }
            }
            
            $user = new UserProfile();
            $user->username = 'PHPMaster';

    - Answer: return this->username


- The UserProfile class has been expanded 
    - To include not just a username but also an visits property to track user engagement through a counter.

    - The class provides methods to increment the counter, reset it, and read it.

        class UserProfile {
            public int $visits = 0;
        
        
            function incrementVisits() {
                $this->visits++;
            }
        
            function resetVisits() {
                $this->visits = 0;
            }
        
            function getVisits() {
                return $this->visits;
            }
        }
     
     
        $user = new UserProfile();
        
        $user->incrementVisits(); 
        $user->incrementVisits(); 
        $user->resetVisits();     
        $user->incrementVisits(); 
        $user->incrementVisits(); 
        $user->incrementVisits();
        $user->incrementVisits();
        $user->incrementVisits();

    - After these operations, what is the output of calling $user->getVisits()?

    - Answer: 5

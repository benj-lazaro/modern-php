Coding Exercise 25: Hotel Room Digitization Part 01
---------------------------------------------------
- Your task is to reconstruct a hotel digitally
    - Starting with its fundamental block: the rooms
    
    - Each room is distinguished by a unique number
        - Offer a variety of facilities (e.g. king-size bed, WiFi access, scenic view)
        - Comes with a daily rate

    - Class requirement
        - A PHP Class named Room

        - It has the following Properties
            - roomNumber (int)  = identifies each room uniquely
            - rate (float)      = daily cost of the room in dollars

        - It has the following public Methods
            - getRoomNumber     = retrieves the room number
            - calculateCost     = calculates & returns the total cost of the stay, given a specified number of days

        - The Method getRoomNumber()
            - Returns the (int) value of the Property roomNumber

        - The Method calculateCost()
            - It accepts a parameter variable "$numberOfDays"
            
            - If "$numberOfDays" is NOT GREATER THAN 0
                - Returns a "null"
                
                - Otherwise returns the product of "$numberOfDays" * $rate
                    - Rounded to two (2) decimal places
                
            - NOTE: Assume that "$numberOfDays" will ALWAYS be provided as an int
                - Test for a value greater than 0, less than 0 and 0


    - NOTE: Udemy's backend is currently running PHP 7
        - It does NOT support EXPLICIT type declarations for Class Properties
            - e.g. AVOID "public int $data", INSTEAD write as "public $data"

Securing Class Methods: From Public To Private Access
-----------------------------------------------------
- The keywords "public" and "private" are applicable to Class Methods
    - And NOT exclusively to Class Properties

    - By default, Methods in a Class are implicitly "public"
        - NOTE: The same with a Class Constructor

    - A private Class Method
        - Meant that it can NOT be accessed outside of a Class
        - It can ONLY be accessed with other Methods within a Class

    - An attempt to use a private Class Method
        - Triggers a "Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to private method"

    - This is applicable to helper Methods of a Class
        - e.g. fetch data from the database for certain use cases

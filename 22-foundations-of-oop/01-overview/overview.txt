Overview
--------
- This section focuses on
    - The general approach of object-oriented programming in PHP

    - Object oriented programming allows to write modular code that
        - Help keep track of even larger projects
        - Maintain control over it

    - It offers a divide & conquer approach
        - Bundling functions (i.e. methods) into classes
        - Addressing earlier concern on 'colliding' function names

    - It offers a new approach to structuring code that
        - Allows to develop more complex applications in PHP


- Why object orienttation is needed?
    - A function rarely stands for itself
        - Usually works or exits with data
        - Data is closely correlated to a function

    - Offers a way to bundle properties & methods in code


- In this section will first build
    - A simple bank account program without using OOP
        - To demonstrate how 'messy' code & difficult to maintain it
    
    - After that explore the concept object orientation
        - Then develop the same program using OOP

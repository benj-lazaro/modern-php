Class Methods: Define Behavior With Objects
-------------------------------------------
- A function defined within a Class is referred to as a "Method"
    - Naming convention
        - Best practice NOT to use a "_" character
        - Capitalize the 1st letter of the succeeding words

    - When a Method access a Property within its own Class
        - Prefix the Property with "$this->"

        - The "$this->" represents the current instance of the Class

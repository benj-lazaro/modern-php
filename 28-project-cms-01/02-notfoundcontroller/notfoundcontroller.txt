Develop The NotFoundController
------------------------------
- Implement a "Controller pattern"
    - Manages requests made by a user
    - Handles pages (or request files) that does NOT exists


- In the project
    - Create a Controller named "NotFoundController"
        - Located w/in "src/Frontend/Controller"
        - Namespace of "App/Frontend/Controller"

    - Create a Method named "error404()"
        - Call the PHP function "http_response_code()"
        - Pass an integer value of 404
        - Echo a custom error message

    - A Controller is basically a Class
        - Has its own Method(s)

    - Open the file "index.php"
        - Fetch the value of the URL parameter "page"
            - If NO value present, assign the value of "index"

        - Save the returned value to the variable "$page"
            - Typecast the return value as string
            - Use "@" to supress warnings

        - Create an instance of the Controller "NotFoundController"
            - Save the object into the variable "$notFoundController"
            - NOTE: Use the full namespace path of the Controller

        - Call the object's method "error404()"

Implement The Error Page
------------------------
- After the Controller "NotFoundController" was created
    - Next is to implement nice looking error page


- In the project
    - Access the file "inc/functions.inc.php"
        - Copy the function "render()"

        - Best implemented w/in a Controller
            - Instead of a stand-alone function
            - It is called (needed) ONLY w/in a Controller

    - Paste the code w/in "NotFoundController.php"
        - Turn the function into a Protected Method
        
        - Refactor the correspodning path filenames of the "require" statements

        - Refactor the "NotFoundController" Method "error404()"
            - Calling the Method "render()"

            - Passing the arguments
                - 1st = "notFound/error404"
                - 2nd = []

    - Create the correspodning View page named "error404.view.php"
        - Located w/in "views/frontend/notFound"

    - Create a new Controller named "AbstractController"
        - Serves as an Abstract Class
            - Located w/in the same Namespace as the "NotFoundController"
        
        - Move the Method "render()" from the Controller "NotFoundController"
            - Into the Controller "AbstractController"

        - Making the Method "Render()" available to ALL Controllers that 
            - Extends the "AbstractController"

    - Refactor the Controller "NotFoundController"
        - To extend from the created "AbstractController"

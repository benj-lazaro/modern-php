Render The Navigation Bar
-------------------------
- Implement a small navigation bar that
    - Allows to switch from one page to another
        - Implement the navigation bar on the View page "views/layouts/main.view.php"
        - Navigation bar items should fetched from the database
    
    - Refactor the Method "render()" of the Controller "src/Frontend/Controller/AbstractController.php"
        - Responsible for rendering
            - Individual View pages (views/frontend) 
            - Main layout "views/layouts/main.view.php"

        - Prior to rendering the main layout
            - The function needs to access the database via Repository "PageRepository.php"
            - To fetch records order ordered by their "id"
            - Save to a variable
            - Variable's value will be rendered as navigation items in the main layout

    - Create a Constructor on the Controller "AbstractController"
        - Accepts a "protected" argument value of type "PageRepository"
            - Parameter variable named "$pageRepository"

        - NOTE: Add a "use" statement for the "App\Repository\PageRepository"
            

    - Refactor the Controller "src/Frontend/Controller/PagesController.php"
        - To address conflict with "AbstractController"

        - Refactor the Constructor
            - Remove the visibility "private" from parameter
        
        - Calls the Constructor of the "src/Frontend/Controller/AbstractController.php"
            - Pass the value stored in "$pageRepository" as an argument value
    

    - Refactor the Repository "src/Frontend/Repository/PagesRepository.php"
        - Implement a Method named "fetchForNavigation()" that 
            - Fetches records from the database
            - Returned as an array of PageModel objects
            - Will be used as items for the navigation bar of the main layout "views/layouts/main.view.php"

    
    - On the Controller "src/Frontend/Controller/AbstractController.php"
        - Stores the returned array from the PageRepository into the variable "$navigation"
        - This variable will be available to the main layout "views/layouts/main.view.php"

    
    - On the main layout "views/layouts/main.view.php"
        - Use a "foreach()" loop to iterate through the array stored in "$navigation"
            - Each record is stored in the variable "$navPage"

        - Add the attribute "class" with the value of "active"
            - If the value of the "$navPage->id" is strictly identical 
                - To the property "id" of the PageModel object
            
            - Check if the variable "$page" passed from the Controller "PagesController" is NOT empty
            - Check if the property "id" is NOT empty
            - Check if the object stored in "$page" is an instance of "App/Model/PageModel.php"


    - Refactor "index.php"
        - On the line prior to calling the Controller "src/Frontend/NotFoundController.php"

        - Create a new instance of the Repository "PageRepository"
            - Stored the object into the variable "$pagesRepository"

        - Pass the variable as an argument value when calling the Controller "NotFoundController"

        - This is to handle non-existent values for the URL parameter "route"
            - None of the navigation items are highlighted
            - Properly renders an error (404) page

Coding Exercise 21: Energy Consumption Forecast 02
--------------------------------------------------
- Your model will utilize the following parameters from part 01
    - "$totalEnergyConsumption" (number)
        - Current energy consumption in kWh

    - "$monthlyIncrease" (number)
        - Expected monthly increase due to expansion

    - "$efficiencyImprovement" (float)
        - Efficiency improvement factor per month

    - "$energyCapacityThreshold" (number)
        - Energy consumption threshold that must NOT be exceeded


- Tasks
    - Calculate time to threshold
        - Determine how many months it will take for "$totalEnergyConsumption"
            - To reach or exceed the "$energyCapacityThreshold"

        - For each iteration (month), apply the
            - "$monthlyIncrease" & "efficiencyImprovement" to the "$totalEnergyConsumption"

        - Should the number of months required to reach the threshold 
            - Extend beyond 50 years (600 months), halt the forecast process
            - Formula: <number_of_years> * 12 <months> = <number_of_months_for_n_years>

    - Display the results
        - If the forecase will be met within 50 years, output the message:

            "It will take [number of months] months to reach or exceed the threshold of [energy capacity threshold] kWh."

        - Otherwise, output the message:

            "The energy consumption threshold of [energy capacity threshold] kWh will not be met within 50 years."

Coding Exercise 20: Energy Consumption Forecast
-----------------------------------------------
- A leading industrial company is focusing on sustainable growth 
    - By monitoring and optimizing its energy consumption amidst rapid expansion

    - Your task is to create a forecast model that 
        - Predicts energy consumption over the next years

        - Considering both the expected increase from operational scaling 
            - And the targeted decrease from implementing energy-efficiency initiatives

    - For your model
        - "$totalEnergyConsumption" (number)
            - Starting energy consumption in kWh
            - Reflecting the initial industrial scale

        - "$monthlyIncrease" (number)
            - Expected monthly increase in kWh due to expansion and new machinery

        - "$efficiencyImprovement" (float)
            - Enhanced efficiency measures aiming for a higher reduction in energy growth rate

        - "$years" (number)
            - Forecast period

- Tasks
    - Calculate the forecast total energy consumption over the specified period
        - Taking into account both 
            - Increase from new developments
            - Decrecrease from efficiency improvements

    - Monthly increase
        - For each month, begin by adding the specified monthly increase in energy

            $newEnergyConsumption = $totalEnergyConsumption + $monthlyIncrease;

    - Efficiency improvements
        - After accounting for the increase
            - Apply the efficiency improvement factor to
            - Slightly reduce the total energy consumption
            
            $newEnergyConsumption *= (1 - $efficiencyImprovement);

    - Repeat for every month of the given years
        - Perform these calculations sequentially for each month
            - Accross the entire forecast period

    - Save the forecast
        - Store the final forecasted energy consumption in "$forecastedEnergyConsumption"
        - Round the value to two (2) decimal places

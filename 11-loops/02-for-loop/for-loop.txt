The "for" Loop: Repeat Actions And Manage Iterations
----------------------------------------------------
- The "for" loop
    - Consists of three (3) expressions
        - 1st = initialization; it is evaluated once unconditionally
        - 2nd = condition; evaluates if the loop will continue or terminate
        - 3rd = incremental / decremental expression
        
        - Each expression is optional
            - Separated from each other using a ";"
    
        - NOTE: Be mindful of the how the 2nd expression is being evaluated
            - Ensure that it will NOT result into an infinite loop

        - NOTE: Leaving the 2nd expression (i.e. condition) empty
            - Will implicitly result to an infinite loop
            - Unless there is a line of code within that brakes the loop

    - Is the perfect loop construct
        - When the number of iterations is known AHEAD of time

Syntax:

for (<expr1>; <expr2>; <expr3>){
    <statement>
    ...
}

for (<expr1>; <expr2>; <expr3>):
    <statement>
    ...
endfor;

// Acceptable but NOT a best practice for single line statement within the loop
for (<expr1>; <expr2>; <expr3>) <single_line_statement>;

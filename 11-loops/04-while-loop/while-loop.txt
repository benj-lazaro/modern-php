The "while" Loop: Execute Code With Conditional Repeats And Avoid Infinite Loops
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The "while" loop
    - Is a loop construct that allows to execute a block of Code
        - As long as the conditional expression is fulfilled

    - Is the loop construct
        - When the number of iterations are NOT known ahead of time
    
    - Common use case
        - Retrieving (unknown number of) records from a database

    - NOTE: Be mindful of the how the conditional expression is evaluated
        - Ensure that it will NOT execute an infinite loop

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.while.php)


- When to use "for", "foreach" or "while" loop 
    - Implement a loop construct, using a "foreach" loop first
    - If it is NOT possible, use a "for" loop
    - Otherwise, use a "while" loop


Syntax:

while (<conditional_expression>) {
    <statement>;
    ...
}

while (<conditional_expression>) :
    <statement>;
    ...
endwhile;

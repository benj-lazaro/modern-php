Optimize Dependency Injection With Container Strategies
-------------------------------------------------------
- The implementation of the previous Container presents an issue
    - Every call to the Container's public Methods
        - Results to the creation of a new & separate instance (Object)
        - Instead of reusing the current (active) one

    - Evident using the function "var_dump()"
        - For each Method call 
            - The instance number increases (e.g. object(PostsRepository)#2, object(PostsRepository)#3)
            - Instead of consistently using the same instance number

    - This strategy prevents
        - The creation of multiple individual (active) instances of its corresponding Class

        - Reuses the current (active) instance
            - (e.g. consistent object(PostsRepository)#2 &object(PostsController)#3)


- On the example code
    - In the Container
        - Declare Private Properties whose type is named after the corresponding Class
            - e.g. private PostsRepository $postsRepository
                   private PostsController $postsController
        
        - On the respective public Methods
            - Implement a check if the Private Property
                - Assigned with an instance of its corresponding Class

            - If the Property is NOT assigned with an instance
                - Crew a new instance of its Class
                - Assign the instance to the Private Property
                - Return the Private Property

            - Otherwise, return the current Private Property
                - Containing the current (active) instance of its corresponding Class

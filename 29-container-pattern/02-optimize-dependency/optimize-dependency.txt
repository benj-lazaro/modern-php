Optimize Dependency Injection With Container Strategies
-------------------------------------------------------
- Further improve the previous Container
    - Addressing the issue demonstrated in the previous code example

    - Calling the Container's respective "get" Methods
        - Creates a new instance of the associated Class (i.e. Controller or Repository)
        - Instead of reusing the Class' current (active) instance

    - NOTE: Use "var_dump()" to view the instance number besides the name of the object


- To address this concern
    - Within the Container
        - Declare a private Property 
            - Whose name & type is based on the corresponding Class (i.e. Controller or Repository)

    - Within the respective "get" Methods
        - Check if the instance of said Class is non-existent
            - If true, create & return a new instance of the Class
            - If false, return the current (active) instance instead

    - This prevents the creation of a new instance of the associated Class

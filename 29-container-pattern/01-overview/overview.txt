Overview
--------
- This section focuses on
    - Container pattern that allows
        - To scale an application
        - To create & manage instances of a Class

    - A Container is basically a Class
        - NOTE: By convention, it is also named "Container"


- Container pattern
    - Address the following concerns
        - Repetitive (manual) setup of instantiating a Class
            - Particularly a Class w/ required dependencies (e.g. another Class instance)
        
        - In the event of a changes in a Class' structure (i.e. dependencies or properties)
            - Requires refactoring lines of related code

    - It contains public Methods that handles
        - The instantiation of a Class including those w/ dependencies

    - A Container is ONLY instantiated ONCE
        - Then calls its public Methods to instantiate an Object from its corresponding Class

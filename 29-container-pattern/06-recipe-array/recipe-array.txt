Implement A Recipe Array For Dynamic Instance Creation 
------------------------------------------------------
- Refactor the Method "get()" of the current Container
    - Address the potential growth of "if" & "else if" statements
        - In order to accomodate future Classes when the app scales up

    - Implement an array of recipes named "$recipes"
        - Each element (i.e. recipe) is an Anonymous Function
            - That instantiates a corresponding Class
            - Uses the (former Private) Property name as key (i.e. postsRepository, postsController)

    - Declare a Constructor
        - Assign the corresponding Anonymous Function to the array "$recipes"
        
    - Refactor the Method "get()"
        - To store the instantiated Object returned by an element of "$recipes" into "$instances"

        - NOTE: To execute the recipe (i.e. Anonymous Function) w/in "$recipes"
            - Place a "()" suffix when referencing it (e.g. $this->recipes['postsRepository']() )
        
        - To address code duplication

        - To implement error handling for non-existent Class(es)
        

- In the Class "Container"
    - Create a Private array named "$recipes"
        - Assign it w/ an empty array

    - Create a Constructor
        - Assign an Anonymous Function as an element of the array "$recipes"
            - Creates & returns the instantiated Object of the corresponding Class
                - Uses the (former Private) Property name as key (i.e. postsRepository, postsController)

            - NOTE: The "$this->" is accessible w/in the closure of an Anonymous Function
                - This is relevant for a Class w/ dependencies from other Classes (e.g. postsController)

            - NOTE: The closure increments the instance counter

    - In the public Method "get()"
        - Replace the line of code that instantiates a Class
            - With a call to the corresponding element of the array "$recipes"
        
        - To execute the corresponding Anonymous Function in "$recipes"
            - Add a pair of "()"
            - e.g. $this->recipes['postsRepository']()

        - Address the repetitive references to
            - Both "postsRepository" & "postsController" w/in the body of "if" statements

            - Reduce to a single "if" statement
                - Replace reference to either "postsRepository" & "postsController" w/ the variable "$what"
                - NOTE: The variable "$what" identifies the Class that is being requested

        - Implement error correction
            - Check if the recipe for the requested Class exists w/in the array "$recipes"

            - If none, prompt an error message
                - Call the function "die()" to terminate the program

Implement A Recipe Array For Dynamic Instance Creation
------------------------------------------------------
- Declare a new Property of Private array named "recipes" on the Class "Container"


- Declare a Constructor
    - Initialze the property "recipes"
    
    - Assign the corresponding Anonymous Function that instantiates an object from their corresponding Class
        - As elements of the array


- Refactor the Method "get()"
    - Replace the "if..else if" statement with a single "if" statement

    - Check if the arrays "instances" and "recipes" are empty
        - If true echo a custom error message
        - Then terminate program execution with "die()"

    - Otherwise
        - Execute the corresponding Anonymous Function in the array "recipes"
            - Save the returned object into the array "instances"

        - Store the object returned by the array "recipes" into the array "instances"

        - Return the array "instances"

Refactor The Container With An Instances Array
----------------------------------------------
- Refactor the Methods of the Container
    - Remove repetitive declarations of the variables "$postsController" & "$postsRepository"
        - Within their respective Methods

    - Create a new Private Property named "$instances"
        - Data type of "array"
        - Initialized with an empty array

        - NOTE: NOT initializing with an empty array
            - Requires creating a Constructor to initialize the Property
            
    - On their respective Methods
        - Check array if it contains an element that is an instance of "PostsController" or "PostsRepository"
        
        - If there are NO instances within the array
            - Create an instance of the corresponding Class
            - Store the instantiated object as an element of the array "$instances"

        - Otherwise
            - Return the active object 

    - The advantage of this approach
        - Allows the code base to be refactored further

    - The disadvantage of this approach
        - Does NOT offer Type Safety
            - The array "$instances" is NOT typed

        - NOTE: This approach produces the same output as the previous implementation

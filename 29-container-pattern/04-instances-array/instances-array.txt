Refactor The Container With An Instances Array
----------------------------------------------
- Refactor the current Container to implement an array as a Private Property
    - Stores instances of their corresponding Classes

    - This approach produces the same objects as the preivous code example
        - It allows the code base to be refactored further
        
        - It does NOT offer type safety
            - The array itself is NOT typed (as either PostsRepository or PostsController)
            - It stores Objects of BOTH Classes as elements
        

- In the Class "Container"
    - Declare a new Private Property named "$instances"
        - Data type "array"
        - Then initialize the Property w/ an empty array

        - NOTE: Initializing w/ an empty array 
            - Removes the need of a Constructor
            - In order to initialize the Private Property "$instances"

    - On the respective Public Methods "getPostsRepository()" & "getPostsController()"
        - Refactor the line that instances a new Object from their corresponding Classes

        - Instead of storing the object into their respective Private Properties
            - Store the created instance as an element of the array "$instances"
            - Use the respective Property name as key (i.e. postsRepository, postsController)

    - Remove the previous declared Private Properties (i.e. $postsRespository, $postsController)

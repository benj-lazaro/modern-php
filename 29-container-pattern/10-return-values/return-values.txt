Enhanced Code Modularity: Utilize Return Values In File Inclusion
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- A little trick to use for a database connection
    - From a function declared w/in an separate file
        - Easier to read 20 or 30 lines of database connection related code
    
    - Use a "require" statement to include
        - The separate file containing the aforementioned function

    - On the separate PHP file
        - Declares the function responsible to establishing a database connection
        - Returns a PDO object via "return" statement

    - On the main PHP file
        - At the same line as the "require" statement
            - Save the returned PDO object into a variable

        - Reference the variable whenver a database connection is needed

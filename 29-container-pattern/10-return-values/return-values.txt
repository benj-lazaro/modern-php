Enhanced Code Modularity: Utilize Return Values In File Inclusion
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- To enchance code modularity
    - Utilize the returned value from a separate (external) file
        - A that that is stored on a local variable of this file
            - Uses a "return" statement to return the variable

    - The main file
        - Includes the separate (external) file using a "require" statement
            - Then assign the "return" statement to a variable

        - The variable holds the returned value from the separate (external) file

    - NOTE: This 'trick' can be used for establishing a database connection
        - External file 
            - Has a functon that establishes a database connection
                - Saves the PDO object in a variable

            - Returns the variable (containsing the PDO object) via "return" statement

        - Main file
            - Receives the PDO object 
                - By assigning the "require" statement to a local variable

            - References the local variable 
                - Whenever a database connection is required


- In the file "index.php"
    - Use a "return" statement to include a separate file "other-file.php"
        - Assign the "return" statement to a variable named "$returnedValue"


- In the file "other-file.php"
    - Assign a string value to a local variable named "$stringData"
    - Use a "return" statement to pass the value stored in the variable "$stringData"

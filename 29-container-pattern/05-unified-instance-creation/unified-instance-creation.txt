Refactor The Container With Unified Instance Creation
-----------------------------------------------------
- Refactor the current Container
    - Consolidate individual Public Methods "getPostsRepository()" & "getPostsController()"
        - Into a single Public Method named "get()"

        - Requires a parameter variable named "$what"
            - Identifies which Class that will be instantiated
            - Then saved as an element in the array "$instances"
            - Using the (former Private) Property name as key (i.e. postsRepository, postsController)

    - This Method is referred as a "Unified Instance Creation"


- In the Class "Container"
    - Delete the Public Methods "getPostsRepository()" & "getPostsController()"

    - Create a new Public Method named "get()"
        - Define the parameter variable "$what"

    - Use an "if" statement to 
        - Identify which Class will be instantiated

    - Use a nested "if" statement to
        - Check if an instance of the Class already exists as an element of the array "$instances"
        
        - If NO element exists in the array
            - instantiate a new Object from the corresponding Class
            - Save it as an element of the array "$instances"

        - Otherwise, return the current instance instead


- Refactor how the Public Method "get()" is called 
    - From both w/in the Method "get()" and the main program
    - Passing "postsRepository" or "postsController" as argument values

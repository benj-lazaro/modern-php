Refactor The Container With Unified Instance Creation
-----------------------------------------------------
- Instead of calling individual public Methods of the Class "Container"
    - They are replaced with a unified instance creation

    - This requires the creation of a single instance of the Class "Container"
        - Calling previous individual public Methods using a single Method named "get()"
        - Passing an argument value based on the names of previous Methods (e.g. postsRepository, postsController)

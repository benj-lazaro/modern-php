Register The Recipes For Instance Creation Outside The Container
----------------------------------------------------------------
- The Private array "$recipes" w/in the Constuctor of the Class "Container"
    - As the application scales up
        - New recipes will be included into the Container
        - Requiring the Constructor to be refactored repeatedly

    - From a code perspective
        - The Private array "$recipes has NOTHING to do with the Class "Container"

    - The Class "Container" is intended simply as a container that
        - Helps build an instance of a Class

        - It should
            - NOT contain the recipes w/in its Constructor
            - Be kept clean & simple
            - Work standalone & use universally

    - The logic that handles the recipes
        - Should be moved from the Constructor
            - Eventually deleting the Constructor

        - Change the Private Property "$recipes"
            - From Private to Public

        - Access the Public Property "$recipes" outside of the Class "Container"
            - To assign the recipe for its corrresponding Class


- In the Class "Container"
    - Change the Property "$recipes"
        - From Private to Public

    - Delete the Constructor


- Outside the Class "Container"
    - After creating its own instance 
        - Stored into the variable "$container"

    - Access the Public Property "$recipes" then
        - Register (assign) the recipe (i.e. Anonymous Function) of the corrresponding Class
        
        - NOTE: Use the function "use()" in order to
            - Import the instance of the container w/in an Anonymous Function
            - Required for a Class that has a dependency 

    - Use the Method "get()"
        - To create an instance of the requested Class

Register The Recipes For Instance Creation Outside The Container
----------------------------------------------------------------
- From a code perspective
    - The "$recipes" has NOTHING to do with the Class "Container"
    
    - The Container is pretty much a container that
        - Build instances of Classes (e.g. PostsRepository, PostsController)
        - Should be kept as clean & simple as possible
        - Should work standalone & use universally

    - To address this concern
        - Declare the Property "recipes" as Public
            - Move it from the Constructor to outside of the Class "Container"
            - Remove the remnant Constructor
            
            - NOTE: Doing so will make the said Property accessible to everyone

        - Refactor the "$recipes" codebase
            - Treat them as accessing the Public Property "recipes"

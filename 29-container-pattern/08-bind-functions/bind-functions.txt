Secure Instance Creation With Private "bind()" Functions
--------------------------------------------------------
- Previously declared a Public Property "recipes" in the Class "Container"
    - An array that functions as a mechanism that registers a 'recipe' for instantiating a particular Class
        - Returns the corresponding object

    - However, this is a Public Property
        - Directly accessible to any part of the code base
        - Allows any part of the code base to add or remove a 'recipe' 


- To address this concern
    - Switch the visibility of the Property "recipes" as Private

    - Create a Public Method named "bind()"
        - Accepts two (2) parameters
            - A string data type "$what"
            - A closure data type (expressed as "\Closure") "$recipe"

        - Adds an element into the Private array "recipes"
            - Whose element's key is based on the value of "$what"
            - Assigns the anonymous function stored in "$recipe"

    - Instead of directly accessing the Property "recipes" from the main code base
        - Calls the Method "bind()", passes two (2) argument values
            - 1st   = Name of the Class whose object will be instantiated from
            - 2nd   = Corresponding closure (anonymous function) that instantiates & returns the corresponding object

        - Effectively listing objects that can be built
            - Binding the recipes (closures) to the corresponding Class names
            - Resolving dependencies

    - Keeps the Class "Container" clean & simple as possible

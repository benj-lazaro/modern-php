Secure Instance Creation With Private "bind()" Functions
--------------------------------------------------------
- Previously, implements a mechanism to register recipes for corresponding Classes
    - However, the array "$recipes" is a Public Property of the Class "Container"
        - Making it directly accessible anywhere w/in the codebase
    
        - Allowing any part of the codebase
            - To directly add or remove a recipe of a corresponding Class

    - To prevent this from happening
        - Switch the Property array "$recipes" 
            - From Public back to Private

        - This removes access to the Property "$recipes" 
            - Anywhere in the codebase

    - To address this concern
        - Create a new Public Method named "bind()"
        
        - It requires two inputs (i.e. parameter variables)
            - 1st parameter named "$what"
                - Accepts a string value that identifies the Class to be instantiated

            - 2nd parameter named "$recipe"
                - Accepts an Anonymous Functions using "\Closure" data type
                - It contains the 'recipe' for instantiating the corresponding Class

        - This Public Method "binds" a Class to its corresponding recipe
            - It is accessible anywhere in the codebase
            - Prevents direct addition / removal of a Class' recipe


- In the Class "Container"
    - Change the Property "$recipes"
        - From Public back to Private

    - Create a new Public Method named "bind()"
        - Accepts two parameters named "$what" & "$recipe"

        - Assigns the value of "$recipe" as an element
            - To the array "$recipes"
            - Using the former Private Property name as key (e.g. postsRepository & postsController)


- Outside of the Class "Container"
    - Calls the Public Method "bind()"
        - 1st parameter = pass the name of the Class to be instantiated
        - 2nd parameter = Anonymous Function that instantiates the corresponding Class

    - NOTE: Use the function "use()" in order to
        - Import the instance of the container w/in an Anonymous Function
        - Required for a Class that has a dependency

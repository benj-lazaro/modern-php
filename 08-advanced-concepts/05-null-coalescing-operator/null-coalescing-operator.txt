Null Coalescing Operator: Simplify Default Value Assignments
------------------------------------------------------------
- PHP 7.0 added support for the Null Coalescing operator (??)
    - It is simply a syntatic sugar of a ternary operator & the PHP function "isset()"

    - The ?? operator evaluates the expression it is in
        - Returns the 1st operand
            - If the expression returns a value that is NOT a "null"

        - Otherwise, returns the 2nd operand (i.e. default value)

    - Reference 
        - Official documentation (https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration70.new-features.php)
        - PHP tutorial (https://www.phptutorial.net/php-tutorial/php-null-coalescing-operator/)


- NOTE: Type casting takes precedence over the Null Coalescing operator
    - Important when type casting the 1st operand

        <data_type_cast> <1st_operand> ?? <2nd_operand>;
    
    - To address this concern
        - Enclose the expression of the Null Coalescing operator w/in a pair of ( )
        - Then type cast the returned value according to the preferred data type

        (<data_type_cast>) (<1st_operand> ?? <2nd_operand>);


Syntax:

$<variable_name> = <first_operand> ?? <second_operand>;

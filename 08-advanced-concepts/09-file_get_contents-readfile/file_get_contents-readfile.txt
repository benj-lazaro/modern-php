The Functions file_get_contents And readfile
--------------------------------------------
- The PHP function "file_get_contents()"
    - Reads an entire file
        - Returns the content as string 

    - Starting at a specified offset (default 0)
        - Up to the specified length (in bytes, default to read until end of file)

    - It is the preferred way to read the contents of a file into a string
        - Uses the host OS' memory mapping techniques
        - IF SUPPORTED in order to enhance performance

    - Returns 
        - Boolean "false" on failure
        - Read data on success

    - Generates a warning if
        - Specified file is NOT found
        - Specified length is less than zero (0)
        - Specified offset in the stream fails

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.file-get-contents.php)


- The PHP function "readfile()"
    - Reads the contents of a file and immediately writes to the output buffer

    - Unlike "file_get_contents()"
        - It does NOT load the content into memory

    - Returns
        - Boolean "false" on failure
        - Number of bytes read on success

    - Generates a warning if specified file is NOT found

    - It is preferred for reading the content of large files

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.readfile.php)


Syntax:

file_get_contents(
    string $filename,
    bool $use_include_path = false,
    ?resource $context = null,
    int $offset = 0,
    ?int $length = null
): string|false

readfile(string $filename, bool $use_include_path = false, ?resource $context = null): int|false

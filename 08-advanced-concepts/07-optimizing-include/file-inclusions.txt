Optimizing include: Use __DIR__ For Reliable File Path Resolution 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- The __DIR__ is a Magic Constant that
    - Returns the current directory of a file

    - When used with the "include" expression
        - It returns the current directory name of the included file
        
        - This is equivalent to "dirname(__FILE__)"
            - Best practice to use __DIR__ instead

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.constants.magic.php#constant.dir)


- The __FILE__ is a Magic Constant that
    - Returns the full path & filename of a file with symlinks resolved

    - When used with the "include" expression
        - It returns the name of the included file

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.constants.magic.php#constant.file)


- The PHP function dirname()
    - Returns a parent's directory path

    - NOTE: It operates naively on input string
        - It is NOT AWARE of the actual filesystem or path components (e.g. . or ..)

    - NOTE: On Windows OS, both / and \ are used as directory separator character

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.dirname.php)


Syntax:

include __DIR__ . "<target_file>";

include dirname(__FILE__);

The @ Symbol: Silence PHP Warnings
----------------------------------
- The @ symbol is referred as an "error control" operator
    - That is prepended to an expression in PHP
    
    - Any diagnostic error (i.e. warning) that might be generated will be supressed
    
    - NOTE: Fatal error(s) will NOT be supressed

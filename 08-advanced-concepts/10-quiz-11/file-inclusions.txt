Quiz 11: Test Your Knowledge About File Inclusions
--------------------------------------------------
- What is the difference between the require and include commands in PHP?
    - Answer: 
        - require will stop execution with a fatal error if the file cannot be included
        - While include will emit a warning but continue execution


- Given the PHP code require './includes/header.php';  
    - That uses a relative path to include a file
    - How would you modify it to use an absolute path for increased reliability?  

    - Answer: require __DIR__ . '/includes/header.php';


- Consider the following PHP code snippet

    require __DIR__ . '/config/settings.php';
    require_once __DIR__ . '/config/settings.php';

    - Assuming config/settings.php exists and contains valid PHP code
        - What would be the outcome of executing this code?

    - Answer: The code executes successfully, including the file exactly once


- You have a file named message.txt, that contains the following text:

    echo file_get_contents(__DIR__ . '/message.txt');

    - From a PHP script start.php located in the same directory, you execute the following line:

    echo file_get_contents(__DIR__ . '/message.txt');

    - What will be the outcome of this operation?

    - Answer: echo file_get_contents(__DIR__ . '/message.txt');

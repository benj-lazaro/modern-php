File Inclusions: include, require And Their *_once Variants 
-----------------------------------------------------------
- The PHP expression "include"
    - Includes and evaluates the specified File

    - If the specified file is NOT found

- The PHP expression "include_once"
    - This expression has similar behavior to the "include"
    
    - The diffeence is that if the code from the file has been included
        - It will NOT be included again
        - And returns a boolean value of "true"

- The PHP expression "require_once"
    - This expression is identifical to "require"

    - The difference is that if the specified file has already been required
        - It will NOT require it again

        - Prevents from triggering a fatal error due to
            - Re-declaring a previously declared function
            - Re-initializing a variable all over again

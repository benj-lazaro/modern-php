------------------------------------------------------------------
- The PHP function "opendir()"
    - Opens up a directory handle (i.e. directory)
        - To be used with in subsequent PHP functions "readdir()", "closedir()"

    - Returns a directory handle resource on success
        - Otherwise, returns a "false" on failure
        
        - Triggers a run-time warning error that is caused by
            - A non-existent directory
            - A directory can NOT be opened due to permission restrictions
            - A filesystem error

    - NOTE: A resource of type "stream" is a special data type that
        - Represents an opened directory

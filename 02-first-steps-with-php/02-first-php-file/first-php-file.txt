A First PHP File & The "echo" Command: Display Text On A Website
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Creating the first PHP file
    - Launch XAMPP's "Apache Web Server" service

    - Launch Chrome browser

    - On the project's root folder
        - Create a new file "index.php"

    - Inside the "index.php" file
        - Generate HTML boilerplate code 
            - Using VS Code's "!" shortcut

        - Add an HTML element <h1> with the content

            "Hey, this is my first .php file"

        - Save the changes

        - Refresh the Chrome browser

    - Behind the scenes
        - Apache Web Server by virtue of file extension
            - Detect the ".php" file extension
            - Hands it over to the PHP interpreter (if installed one)

        - PHP interpreter goes through the file's code
            - Checks for PHP keywords, function, etc. 
                - Generates the corresponding content

            - Hands it back to the Apache Web Server

        - Apache Web Server receives the content
            - Serves the content to the Chrome browser

        - Chrome browser receives the content
            - Renders it on its (currently active) window

    - To insert PHP code within a HTML document
        - Use the following line

            <?php <php_code_here> ?>

        - The "<?php" infoms the Apache Web Server that
            - This is the start of a PHP block of code

        - The "?>" signifies the end of the PHP code block

            - NOTE: This code block does NOT appear in the HTML document
                - When viewed using Chrome browser's "View page source"
                - It ONLY shows the generaed content from the PHP's code block

        - NOTE: PHP code can be embedded as content within a HTML element (e.g. <h1>)


- The "echo" statement is a PHP language construct (NOT a function)
    - It outputs one or more expression passed as a parameter value
        - Enclosed within a pair of ' ' or " "
        
    - It does NOT add newlines or space to the expression
    
    - It does NOT have a return value (i.e. void)

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.echo.php)

Syntax:

echo '<string>';
echo "<string>";

echo '$<variable_name>';
echo "$<variable_name>";

echo <expression>;
echo <function>;

- The function "rand()" generates a random integer
    - It optionally accepts two paramters
        - First paramter    = minimum number generated
        - Second parameter  = maximum number generated (inclusive)

    - If called without the optional parameters
        - Returns an integer between 0 and the value returned by "getrandmax()"

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.rand.php)

Syntax:

rand([min, max]);

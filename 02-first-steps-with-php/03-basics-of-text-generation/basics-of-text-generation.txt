The Basics Of Text Generation With PHP: Create Dynamic Background Colors
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- PHP generates HTML markup
    - The browser renders the corresponding HTML markup


- PHP can generate any arbitrary text that
    - Can be rendered by the browser as HTML markup

    - Common use case:
        - Dynamically change the assigned value of an element's "class" attribute
            - Using a combination of "echo" and "rand()"

    - NOTE: The browser does NOT care where the generated HTML markup came from
        - It just renders the HTML markup received from the (Apache) Web Server

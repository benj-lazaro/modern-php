Project: Multi-Page Restaurant Website (Displaying Data & Exercise)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- Address the glaring concerns from the previous lecture
    - Each page's corresponding header background image & title


- Implementation
    - Open the file "ingredients.php"

    - Define a variable named "$pageTitle"
        - Place it BEFORE the "include" statement
        - Assign it the the value of "Ingredients"
        - Save the changes

    - Open the file "inc/header.inc.php"
        - On the HTML element <title>
        
        - Replace the content right after the "&bull;" character
            - With the following PHP code

                <?php echo $pageTitle ?>

            - Dynamically generates the assigned value of the variable "$pageTitle"

        - Save the changes
            - Reload the page

    - Open the file "our-mission.php"

    - Define a variable named "$pageTitle"
        - Place it BEFORE the "include" statement
        - Assign it the the value of "Our Mission"
        - Save the changes


- To address the header background image
    - Switch back to "inc/header.inc.php"

    - On the HTML element <header>
        - Look at the attribute "style"
            - Select & cut the content of the "url()"
        
        - Replace it with the following PHP code

            <?php echo $headerImg; ?>

        - Save the changes

    - Switch back to "our-mission.php" file
        - Declare a new variable named "$headerImg"
            - Just below the variable "$pageTitle"

            - Paste the content taken from "/inc/header.inc.php" 
                - As the assigned value

        - Save the changes

    - Switch to the "ingredients.php" file
        -  Repeat the same procedure
            - With the exception of a different value (i.e. image) being assigned

        - Save the changes

    
- Exercise
    - Add & integrated a 3rd page into the website (menu.html)
        - The HTML document and associated images are included with the starter files

    - Use the lessons learned from the previous lectures
        - Rename the page from ".html" to ".php"
        - Include the shared header & footer sections in the new page
        - Dynamically update the page's title and header background image

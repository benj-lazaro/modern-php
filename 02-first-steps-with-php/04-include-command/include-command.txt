The include Command: Combine multiple PHP files
-----------------------------------------------
- The "include" expression includes and evaluates the specified file
    - Allows to split PHP code into multiple files
    
    - Allows to build a common HTML structure that is shared between pages
        - Simplifying the deployment of simple HTML websites

    - NOTE: The filename extension does NOT have to be ".php" (e.g. ".txt")
        - As long as it contains valid PHP code
            - PHP interpreter will read, evaluate & execute the code

        - HOWEVER, this is to be AVOIDED
            - It is best practice for files to be included 
                - To use the ".php" file extension

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php)

Syntax:

include '<path_name/filename>';

include '<filename>';

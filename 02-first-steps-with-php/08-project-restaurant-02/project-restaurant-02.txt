Project: Multi-Page Restaurant Website (Refactor)
-------------------------------------------------
- Use PHP to simplify the management of manually added links
    - On each individual page's navigation bar

    - The advantage of this approach
        - Both header & footer section of the pages
            - Will come from their respective ".php" file
            - Reduces duplication of header & footer markup on succeeding pages


- Implementation
    - Rename the file extension ".html" to ".php"
        - Allows the Apache Web Server to call the PHP interpreter
        - Have the embedded PHP code evaluated & executed by PHP interpreter

    - Update the link references on each page's navigation bar
        - From ".html" to ".php"

    - Create a new folder named "inc" (short for includes)
        - Move inside the folder "inc"

    - Create a new file "header.inc.php"
        - NOTE: The ".inc" part is an OPTIONAL naming convention
            - Signifying that it is NOT MEANT to run as a standalone

    - Switch back to "ingredients.php"
        - Select from the beginning line up to starting HTML element <main>
        - Cut the block of HTML markup
        - Leaving the HTML element <main> and the rest of the code base
    
    - Paste the content in "header.inc.php"
        - Save the changes

    - Switch back to "ingredients.php"
        - Add a PHP's "include" statement at the start of the file
            - Include the file "inc/header.inc.php"

        - Save the changes

    - Move inside the folder "inc"
        - Create a new file "footer.inc.php"

    - Switch back to the "ingredients.php"
        - Select from the closing HTML element </main> up to the last line of code
        - Cut the block of HTML markup

    - Paste the content in "foother.inc.php"
        - Save the changes

    - Switch back to "ingredients.php"
        - Add a PHP's "include" statement at the last line of the file
            - Include the file "inc/footer.inc.php"

        - Save the changes
        - Refresh the page

    - Implement the same procedures on "our-mission.php"
        - Save the changes

        - NOTE: Two glaring concerns will be addressed on the next lecture
            - The content of the page's HTML element <title> 
            - The page's header background image

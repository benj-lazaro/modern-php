Project: Multi-Page Restaurant Website (Introduction)
-----------------------------------------------------
- To develop a simple multi-page website
    - Use PHP to help implement the project


- The project is a restaurant website (Culinary Cove)
    - It has a single page (our-mission.html)
        - Contains the site's mission statement
        - It has a footer


- Create a new page (ingredients.html)
    - Intended to hold information about ingredients
    
    - Copy the file "our-mission.html"
        - Rename it to "ingredients.html"

    - Update the header image & content of "ingredients.html"
        - NOTE: Copy the content from the provided starter files

    - Save the changes


- Open the page (mission.html)
    - Manually add a link to the "ingredients.html" file 
        - In the navigation bar
    
    - On the <nav> element
        - Add the following HTML markup link

        <a href="ingredients.html">Ingredients</a>

    - Save the changes

    - Reload the page (mission.html)


- NOTE: As the project grows into multiple pages over time
    - Manually updating the navigation bar proved to be unmaintainable

    - The next section will focus on how PHP
        - Simplifies the update of new links added into the navigation bar

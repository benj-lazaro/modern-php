Coding Exercise 07: Playlist Song Manager Part 01
-------------------------------------------------
- The variable "$playlist" contains an array that might look like this:

    ['Starry Night', 'Moonlit Walk', 'Whispering Wind', 'Golden Horizon']


- Playlist verification
    - Start by determining if "$playlist" is set and contains any tracks
    
    - If NOT return the message

        "Your playlist needs an update. Time to discover more music!"


- Song presence check
    - Search "$playlist" for a specific track "Sunny Days"
    
    - If found return the message 

    "You have great taste! 'Sunny Days' always lifts the mood!"


- Platlist update from missing 'Sunny Days'
    - If the track "Sunny Days" is NOT found AND has at least two (2) songs available

    - Update the "$playlist" by replacing the song in the 2nd position (index 1)
        - With the song "Solar Whispers"

Coding Exercise 10: Workshop Attenance Coordination 02
------------------------------------------------------
- Continuation of the previous coding exercise (#09)
    - Proceed from where Part 1 left off
        - With a cleaned and sorted list of potential attendees

    - The exercise introduces
        - Concept of priority handling and backup candidates 
            - To further refine the selection process

    - The variable "$waitingList"
        - Is a cleaned up and sorted array
        - Containing names of people who signed up for the workshop

    - The variable "$priorityParticipants"
        - Is a sorted array
        - Containing names of people who should be given priority for the workshop
        - EVEN IF they are NOT part of the "$waitingList"

    - The variable "$individualName"
        - Contains a string
        - Representing a name of an individual


- Tasks
    - Priority inclusion & selection
        - Define a variable "$finalAttendees"
        - Assigns a sorted array with NO duplicates
        - Consists of UP TO 5 elements

        - Starts by including the TOP 5 elements from "$priorityParticipants"
            - Then fill the remaining slot from elements of "$waitingList"
            - UNTIL it reaches five (elements)

    
    - Backup candidates identification
        - After finalizing "$finalAttendees"
            - Select and assign the next three (3) names to "$backupCandidates"
            
            - Ensure that these are distinct from "$finalAttendees"
                - Without any duplications

            - Backup could also include "$priorityParticipants" who 
                - Are NOT included in the "$finalAttendees"
                    - In cases that there are more than five (5)
                
                - Generate & display a personalized message to participants

    - Individual status inquiry
        - Assess the status of a specific individual with respect to their attendance 
            - The predefined variable "$individualName" will be used to identify the person

        - Identify which group an individual falls in
            - Is this person from the "$finalAttendees", "$backupCandidates" or "$waitingList"

            - If the person is from "$finalAttendees"
                - Their status is "Final Attendee"

            - If the person is from "$backupCandidates"
                - Their status is "Backup Candidate"

            - For those who remain in the "$waitingList"
                - Their status is "Waiting, position <array_NOT_INDEX_position>" 
    
            - If the person is NOT present in any list
                - Their status is "Not found"

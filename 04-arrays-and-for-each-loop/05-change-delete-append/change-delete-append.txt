Change, Delete & Append Elements To An Array
--------------------------------------------
- To change / update an existing element of an array
    - Simply assign a new value using the "=" operator and corresponding key (i.e. index)

        <array_name>[target_index] = <new_value>;


- To delete an existing element from an array
    - Use the function "unset()"

    - NOTE: The integer keys of the array will NOT be updated
        - After the targeted element has been removed

        - Recommended to refrain from using when possible
            - Better to write the code without using "unset()"


- To append a new element into an array
    - To add at the end of an array

        <array_name>[] = <new_element>;


    - To add at a specific key (i.e. index)

        <array_name>[<key>] = <new_element>;

        - NOTE: This may unintentionally overwrite an existing element
            - If left unchecked

Add Pagination
--------------
- To implement pagination in the web application
    - First, define the entrie' sort order
        - By default, MySQL database records are sorted based on their Primary ID
    
    - For the application's requirements
        - Sort entries by date in descending order
        - Then by their Primary ID, in the event of an entry with an identical date

        SELECT * FROM `entries` ORDER BY `date` DESC, `id` DESC;

    - Refactor the SQL statement in the "index.php"
        - Implement the updated SQL statement


- To limit the records fetched from the MySQL database
    - Use the clause "LIMIT" followed by an integer that
        - Represents the number of records to be fetched
    
        SELECT * FROM `entries` ORDER BY `date` DESC, `id` DESC LIMIT <num_of_records>;


- To fetch suceeding records
    - Use the clause "OFFSET" followed by an integer that
        - Skips the specified number of records to be skipped

        SELECT * FROM `entries` ORDER BY `date` DESC, `id` DESC LIMIT <num_of_records> OFFSET <records_to_skip>;

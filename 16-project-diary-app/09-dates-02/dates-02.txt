Dates Part 02
-------------
- To convert a human-readable date into a UNIX timestamp
    - Use the function "mktime()"
        - Pass the required argument values (human-readable date)
        - Returns an integer value representing the UNIX timestamp
    
    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mktime.php)


- To determine the elapsed time between
    - A previous (fixed) UNIX timestamp and a current timestamp

    - Use the function "mktime()" to convert the fixed date-time
        - Into a UNIX timestamp then store it in a variable

    - Subtract the returned UNIX timestamp from the function "time()"
        - With the variable storing the fixed UNIX timestamp


- To format a UNIX timestamp into a preferred format
    - Use the function "date()"
        - Pass the preferred format as the 1st argument
        - Pass the UNIX timestamp as the 2nd argument

    - NOTE: Do set the preferred timezone first
        - Using the function "date_default_timezone_set()"
        - Pass the supported timezone as argument


- To convert a string date into a UNIX timestamp
    - Use the function "strtotime()"
        - Pass the string date as argument
        - Returns a UNIX timestamp
    
    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php)

    - NOTE: It offers less control compared to the function "mktime()"
        - A workaround is to explode the string using the function "explode()"
            - Returns an array
            - Store elements of the array into individual variables

        - Pass the variables as arguments to the function "mktime()"
            - Returns a UNIX timestamp

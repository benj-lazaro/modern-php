The Form Page
-------------
- Refactor the codebase to reduce redundant HTML markup for easy maintenance
    - Seperate HTML markup from the header section up to a portion of the main container
        - Then the footer section HTML markup
    
    - Each pasted into their respective individual files (.php)
        - Stored into the directory named "views"

    - Then require the sections back into the "index.php" and "form.php" files


- Implement the initial data entry logic for the "form.php"
    - Refactor the attribute "action" of the HTML element <form>
        - From "index.html" to "index.php"
    
    - By doing so the submitted data will be processed
        - By the logic that will be implemented

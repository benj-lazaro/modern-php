Upload Files Part 02
--------------------
- Addressing the security problem on the previous section's implementation
    - With the function "move_upload_files()" for uploading an image Files
        - Previous implementation supports EVERY file type


- To address this concern
    - The easiest way is to simply rename the submitted file's filename & extension
        - Using the function "time()"
        
        - Pass it as argument to the function "move_upload_files()"
            - Force a new filename extension of ".jpg"

    - Alternatively, retrieve the submitted file's filename without its extension
        - Using the function "pathinfo()"
            - Pass the file's filename as 1st argument
            - Pass the flag 'PATHINFO_FILENAME" as 2nd argument
            - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.pathinfo.php)
        
        - Then perform a regular expression search & replace on the filename
            - Using the function "preg_replace()"
            - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.preg-replace.php)
        
        - Search characters that is NOT
            - A lowercase or uppercase 'a' to 'z'
            - Number from 0 to 9
        
        - Replace the character with a '' if found
            - Save the updated changes to a variable

        - Then pass the variable as an argument to the function "move_upload_files()"
            - Force a new filename extension of ".jpg"


- Another issue of the previous implementation
    - Uploading the same file twice, simply overwrites the old file


- To address this concern
    - Add a UNIX timestamp to every file that is being uploaded to the server

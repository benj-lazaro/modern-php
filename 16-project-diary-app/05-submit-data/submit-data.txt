Submit Data Into The Database

- Implement the logic to submit user data into the MySQL database


- Implement error handling when working with an empty user entry
    - Add the attribute "required" on the HTML element <input> of the "form.php"
    - Serves as a data validation mechanism on the client-side
    - Prevents users from submitting an empty entry


- Manually redirect users (for now) back to "index.php"
    - After submitting an entry to the MySQL database

Catch Invalid Uploads
---------------------
- Refactor "form.php" to implement a way to catch an invalid file upload
    - Despite being able to change the filename & extension of a submitted file
    
    - A non-image file can cause the web application a Fatal Error
        - Caused by an Uncaught DivisionByZeroError
        
        - The PHP function "getimagesize()" returns a boolean "false"
            - Assigning the values for the width & height with "null"

        - Calculating the scale factor for the submitted image file
            - Results to a division by zero 
    
    - Implement a check for the submitted image file's width & height
        - In the absence of these values
        - The submitted file will simply be ignored


- Implement check if the submitted image file is of "jpeg" format
    - The PHP function "imagecreatefromjpeg()" returns
        - Either a GdImage (representation of the image file) or a boolean "false"

Dates Part 01
-------------
- Working with dates in PHP
    - PHP provides a function named "time()"
    - Alternatively, PHP offers another function named "microtime(true)"


- PHP function "time()"
    - Returns a integer (int) value that 
        - Represents the current UNIX timestamp
    
    - It is measured in the number of seconds
        - Since the Unix Epoch (01/01/1970 00:00:00 GMT)

    - It consumes 32-bits or 4 bytes of storage
        - To store a date

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.time.php)


- PHP function "microtime()"
    - Returns a string that 
        - Represents the current UNIX timestamp with microseconds included
        - Accurate to the nearest microsecond

    - NOTE: Available ONLY on operating systems that 
        - Supports the "gettimeofday()" system call (i.e. Linux & Mac OS machines)       
        - On Windows OS machine, the clock may NOT be accurate

    - Often used for performance measurement
        - PHP Manual recommends using "hrtime()" instead

    - Passing an argument value of "true"
        - Returns a float instead of a string

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.microtime.php)


- To convert the UNIX timestamp into a human-readable date
    - First, PHP needs to inform which timezone it should operate in
        - Using the function "date_default_timezone_set()"

        - It accepts a string argument value representing the timezone ID
            - Supported timezone IDs (https://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php)
        
        - It returns a boolean value
            - A value of "false" meant that the given timezone is NOT VALID

        - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.date-default-timezone-set.php)

    
    - Next, ask PHP for the current date (and time)
        - Using the function "date()"
        
        - Pass a format string as argument value; separated by a "-"
            - Y = year
            - m = month
            - d = day
            - H = 24-hour format 
            - i = minutes
            - s = seconds

            - Date Time Interface format (https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php)

        - Returns the current date
            - Based on the given format string

        - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php)

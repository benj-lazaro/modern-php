Upload Files Part 01
--------------------
- To upload a file to a server using the method "POST"
    - ONLY uploads the filename but NOT the actual file
    - Demonstrated by accessing the Associative array "$_POST"


- Add the attribute "enctype" in the HTML element <form>
    - Assign the value "multipart/form-data"
    
    - This informs the server how to submit the file to a server


- To access details of the file after submission
    - Access the Associative array "$_FILES", NOT "$_POST"

    - Returns important details that can be used to perform post-submission checks
        - Includes filename, path, file type, temporary name & file size
    
    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.files.php)


- Moving the submitted file from its temporary location to a new (secure) one
    - Use the PHP function "move_uploaded_file()"

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.move-uploaded-file.php)

    - NOTE: Check the new location's "read & write" permissions for "others"
        - In order to successfully transfer the submitted file
    
    - IMPORTANT: To prevent from a harmful file from being executed remotely
        - Implement file type checks
        - Prevent unrecognized type from being moved

- Implement the logic (links) for the pagination buttons
    - Need to find out how many records are currently stored in the database table
        - Use the function COUNT()
        - Pass the argument value "*" (i.e. all records in the database table)
        - Returns an interger value that specifies the current number of records

        SELECT COUNT(*) AS `count` FROM `entries`

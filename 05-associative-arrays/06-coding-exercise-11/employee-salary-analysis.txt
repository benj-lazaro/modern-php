Coding Exercise 11: Employee Salary Analysis 01
-----------------------------------------------
- Work with 3 Associative arrays
    - Each array maps employee names to their respective salaries in dollars
        - "$hrSalaries"
        - "$salesSalaries"
        - "$itSalaries"


- Tasks
    - Calculate department expenditures
        - Sum up the salaries in each department
        
        - Create "$totals" to consolidate this information
            - This information is structured as follows:

            [ 'HR' => $hrTotal, 'Sales' => $salesTotal, 'IT' => $itTotal ];

    - Determine the highest expenditures
        - Analyze total expenditures across the departments
        - Pinpoint the one with the highest monthly salary expenditures
        - Record the department's name in a variable "$maxDept"

Best Practices For Managing Associative Arrays
----------------------------------------------
- An Associative array can accept a new value without an assigned key
    - PHP IMPLICTLY assigns a numeric index (begins at 0)

    - NOTE: Using said numeric key as a string
        - PHP is able to access the associated value
        - Despite being a different type 

        - Succeeding values without a key
            - PHP increments the numeric index by 1


- For best practice
    - It is HIGHLY advised to refrain from mixing Associative array elements with normal array elements
        - Consider each array as separate data structures
        - Even if the former is capable of supporting numeric index elements
        - This likely lead to bloated and confusing code at a later time

    - Best to keep the code (and data structure) simple & clear

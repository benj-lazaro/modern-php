Define An Associative Array
---------------------------
- Similar to defining a normal array EXCEPT
    - That is uses a key to associate its corresponding (assigned) value

    - The keys are NOT integer-based anymore
        - Often are string-based keys

    - To access a value
        - Pass the associated key as an argument to the pair of []
        - Similar to that of accessing a value using a numeric index key

    - Associative arrays in PHP are
        - Efficient and heavily optimized


- Use the function "isset()"
    - To check for the existence of a key inside an Associative array 
    - Returns a boolean value


- Use the function "!empty()"
    - To check if a key exists & has been set & NOT empty
    - Returns a boolean value


Syntax:

// Classic array creation
$<variable> = array(
    <key> => <value>,
    ...
    <key> => <value>[,]
);

// Modern (preferred) array creation
$<variable> = [
    <key> => <value>,
    ...
];

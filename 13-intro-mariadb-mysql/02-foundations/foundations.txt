Foundations: From Excel Spreadsheet To Database Tables
------------------------------------------------------
- An Excel spreadsheet is basically equivalent
    - To a MySQL / MariaDB database table


- The named column header of a sheet is equivalent
    - To a MySQL / MariaDB database field


- The act of defining or naming a column is equivalent
    - To defining the schema of the data to be stored
        - That will be stored on said column(s)

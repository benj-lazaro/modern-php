Auto Increment: Generate Unique IDs With Ease
---------------------------------------------
- When adding a new record to the database table
    - Requires manually assigning a unique value (i.e. Primary Key)
        - To the "unique column" of a table

    - Failing to do so will trigger an "Incorrect integer value" error
        - Due to NOT assigning a unique integer value (i.e. Primary Key)
            - To the designated "unique column"

    - Assigning a duplicate "Primary Key" value 
        - Triggers a "Duplicate entry" error
        - Indicating that said "Primary Key" already assigned to a pre-existing record


- To address the need of manually assigning a "Primary Key"
    - When adding a new record to the database table

    - Click the tab "Structure"
    
    - On the designated "unique column"
        - Click the link "Change"

    - Loads the page containing the properties of the "unique column"
        - Click the checkbox "AUTO_INCREMENT"
        - Click the button "Save"

    - Loads the page of the tab "Structure"
        - The "unique column" has an "AUTO_INCREMENT" value
            - Assigned on its "Extra" column

        - This meant that the "Primary Key" will be automatically generated
            - Incrementing the previous value of the "Primary Key" value by 1


- Inserting a new record into the database table
    - Ignoring to manually provide a "Primary Key"
        - Will NOT result to an error
        - Instead MySQL / MariaDB will automatically generated & assign one

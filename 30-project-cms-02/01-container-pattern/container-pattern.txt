Utilize Container Pattern In The CMS
------------------------------------
- Implement the Container pattern on the CMS project


- On the CMS project
    - Copy the file "better-container.php" from the previous chapter
        - Create a new folder named "src/Support"
        - Paste the file into the folder
        - Rename it to "Container.php"

    - Refactor the file "src/Support/Container.php"
        - Add the namespace "App\Support"

    - Open the file "index.php"
        - Create a new instance of the Container pattern named "Container"
            - Save the instance into the variable named "$container"

    - Switch to the file "inc/db-connect.inc.php"
        - At the end of the codebase, add a "return" statement
        - To return the database connection stored in the variable "$pdo"
        
    - Switch to the file "inc/all.inc.php"
        - Copy the "require" statement for the file "inc/db-connect.inc.php"
            - Then comment the line of code

        - Intended to load this file manually, ONLY when needed

    - Switch back to the file "index.php"
        - Within the anonymous function for the "pdo"
            - Declare a "return" statement
            - Paste the "require" statement copied from the file "inc/all.inc.php"
            - NOTE: This serves as the recipe for a database connection

        - Register the recipe for the Class "PagesRepository"
            - Use the method ".bind()" of the Class "Container"
                - Pass the argument values 
                    - 1st argument = "pagesRepository"
                    - 2nd argument = anonymous function
                        - NOTE: Use the keyword "use" & pass "$container" as an argument value

                - Inside the anonymous function
                    - Use the method ".get()" of the Container
                    - Pass the argument value "pdo"
                    - Save the database connection object in the variable "$pdo"

                - Declare a "return" statement
                    - Copy the line of code that instantiates the Class "PagesRepository"
                    - Pass the variable "$pdo" as an argument values

        - Register the recipe for the Class "PagesController"
            - Use the method ".bind()" of the Class "Container"
                - Pass the argument values 
                    - 1st argument = "pagesController"
                    - 2nd argument = anonymous function
                        - NOTE: Use the keyword "use" & pass "$container" as an argument value

                - Inside the anonymous function
                    - Use the method ".get()" of the Container
                    - Pass the argument value "pagesRepository"
                    - Save the database connection object in the variable "$pagesRepository"

                - Declare a "return" statement
                    - Copy the line of code that instantiates the Class "PagesController"
                    - Pass the variable "$pagesRepository" as an argument values

        - Within the "if" statment that instantiates the Class "PagesController"
            - Use the Method ".get()" of the Class "Container" stored in "$container"
                - Pass the argument value "pagesController"
                - Save the instantiated object in the variable "$pagesController"

        - Register the recipe for the Class "NotFoundController"
            - Use the method ".bind()" of the Class "Container"
                - Pass the argument values 
                    - 1st argument = "notFoundController"
                    - 2nd argument = anonymous function
                        - NOTE: Use the keyword "use" & pass "$container" as an argument value

                - Inside the anonymous function
                    - Use the method ".get()" of the Container
                    - Pass the argument value "pagesRepository"
                    - Save the database connection object in the variable "$pagesRepository"

                - Declare a "return" statement
                    - Copy the line of code that instantiates the Class "NotFoundController"
                    - Pass the variable "$pagesRepository" as an argument values

        - Within the "else" statement
            - Remove the line of code that instantiates the Class "PagesRepository"

            - Use the Method ".get()" of the Class "Container" stored in "$container"
                - Pass the argument value "notFoundController"
                - Save the instantiated object in the variable "$notFoundController"

        - Save the changes

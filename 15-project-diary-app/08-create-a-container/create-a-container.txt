Create A Container
------------------
- Implement a container for the web application's main area
    - It will contain all of the cards to be implemented later
        - Limits the width of its child element(s)

    - NOTE: CSS property "box-sizing" with value of "border-box"
        - Automatically resizes child / targeted element's width
            - In relation to the element's border

        - If the child element's "width" is set to 100%
            - The child element content will be resized
            - To fit within its borders
            - Instead of expanding outwards (i.e. "box-sizing: content-box")


- Implement the same container on the contents of the nav bar
    - NOTE: NOT the nav bar rather its children instead

    - This breaks the placement orientation of the child elements
        - Due to the HTML element <nav> being configured as a flexbox container

    - Move the flexbox configuration from the CSS Element selector "nav"
        - Transfer into a new CSS Class selector named "nav__layout"

    - Declare a new child HTML element <div> inside the <div> with the class of "container"
        - Declare the HTML attribute "class"
        - Assign the value "nav__layout"

    - Move the child element of the HTML element <div> with the class "container"
        - Into the child HTML <div> with the class "nav__layout"

    - Save the changes

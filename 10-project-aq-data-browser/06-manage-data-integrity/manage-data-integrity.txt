Manage Data Integrity & Integrate Additional Measurement Parameters (PM10)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Implement data integrity checks
    - Noted negative "pm25" values from the property "value"
        - This indicates a potential measurement error (i.e. faulty data)

    - Implement code that skips over these negative values
        - Prior to saving individual entries into the array "$stats"


- Next is to calculate for additional parameters
    - Tracking data for "pm10" values
        - Referring to litte larger fine dusts
        - As opposed to "pm25" finer dusts

    - Refactor the "$stats" array
        - To include data of "pm10" values

        - Create sub-levels for "pm25" and "pm10" values

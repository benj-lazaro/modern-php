Polishing The Output: Add Numeric Formatting And Measurement Units
------------------------------------------------------------------
- Improving the "view" page of the selected city
    - Formatting (truncate) the "PM 2.5" and "PM 10" values
    
    - Add measurement units
        - Extract from the property "unit"
        - Instead of hard coding the unit of measurement in HTML
        - Due to weather stations changing the unit of measurement for "PM 2.5" & "PM10" values

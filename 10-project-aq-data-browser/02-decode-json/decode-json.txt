Processing The Air Quality Data: Decode JSON & Handle .bzip Compression
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The file "index.json" located within the folder "data"
    - Serves as an index for selected countries and their corresponding ".bz2" file


- To load / read the file "index.json" directly from the local filesystem
    - Use the PHP function "file_get_contents()" in conjunction with the magic constant "__DIR__"
        - Reads the entire file into a string
        - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.file-get-contents.php)


- To convert the content of the JSON file into an array(ish)
    - Use the PHP function "json_decode()" to decode the JSON into a string
        - Pass a parameter "true" to convert the decoded string into an Associative array

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.json-decode.php)


- To determine the size of a file
    - Use the PHP function "filesize()"
    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.filesize.php)


- To handle a file with .bz2 extension in PHP
    - First check if the PHP interpreter is configured to handle it
        - Use the PHP function "phpinfo()" to render the 
            - Current configuration of the PHP interpreter on the browser

        - Search for "Registered PHP Streams"
            - Check if "compress.bzip2" is included

        - Search for "bz2"
            - Check if "BZip2 Support" is enabled

    - Use a file wrapper

Typed Functions: Secure & Document Your Code
--------------------------------------------
- To declare a type on the function's parameter variable(s)

    function <name>(<type> <paremeter_name>) {
        ...
    }

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.declarations.php)


- Whenever a "Fatal error: Uncaught TypeError" is triggered
    - When passing an argument value to a function

    - PHP identifies which argument value triggered the error
        - What data type the parameter expects to receives
        - Identifies the data type that was passed


- Offers additional safeguards
    - PHP explicitly checks the data type of a function
    
    - During coding, the "PHP Intelephense"
        - Immediately flags an error
        - Before the PHP script is executed


- Type declaration also helps documenting the code
    - Helpful as a project's codebase grows in size over time
    - Helpful for other developers who might work on the code at a later time


- NOTE: When working with an argument value of data type "array"
    - Currently, PHP does NOT have the ability to declare the type of each element

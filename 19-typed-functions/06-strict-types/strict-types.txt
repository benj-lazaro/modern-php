Strict Types: Enforce Accurate Type Handling
--------------------------------------------
- PHP the the ability to IMPLICITLY converts
    - A string argument value to an integer
    - When the function's parameter list requires an integer
    - IMPLICIT conversions can be EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to debug


- To enforce strict typing within a .php file
    - On the first line RIGHT AFTER <?php

    - Type the line

        declare(strict_types=1);

    
    - Doing so diables PHP's ability to perform
        - IMPLICIT (data) type conversions

    - During execution, a "Fatal error: Uncaught TypeError" is triggered
        - Whenever an IMPLICIT type conversions occurs

    - NOTE: This is similar to JavaScript's "Strict Mode"

    - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED enabling "strict_types" as it
        - Make debugging code easier
        - Make the code significantly more reliable

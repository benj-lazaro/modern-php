The Short if Statement
----------------------
- PHP's short "if" statement
    - Drops the "if" keyword
        - Retains the pair of ( ) holding the conditional expression
        - Followed by "?" operator
        - Single statement to execute if condition evaluates to true
        - Then a ":" operator
        - Next is the single statement to execute if the condition evaluates to false

    - Applicable for "if" statements
        - That ONLY has a single statment to execute

    - NOTE: Syntax is similar to JavaScript's "Ternary operator"


Syntax:

(<conditiona> ? <statement_if_true> : <statement_if_false>);

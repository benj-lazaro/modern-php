Quiz 09: Test Your Knowledge Of Form Methods 
--------------------------------------------
- What is the primary difference between using 
    - The GET method (as in the example) and the POST method in an HTML form

    - Answer: GET appends data to the URL; POST delivers data without displaying it in the URL


- Given the HTML form for tech support service requests:

    <form action="submitTicket.php" method="GET">
        <input type="text" name="serviceRequest" />
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>

    - How can you set "Computer Not Starting" 
        - As the default value for the service request

    - Answer: <input type="text" name="serviceRequest" value="Computer Not Starting" />


- Building upon the previous scenario with the tech support service request form:


    <form action="submitTicket.php" method="GET">
        <input type="text" name="serviceRequest" />
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>

    - We want to modify the form so that 
        - The value of the serviceRequest input field is set 
        - To the value passed in the $_GET query parameter, if it exists.

    - How should the value attribute of the input field be set in PHP 
        - To achieve this?

    - Answer: value=<?php if (!empty($_GET['serviceRequest'])) echo $_GET['serviceRequest']; ?>


- Consider a content management system where users can create and edit articles
    - The system provides an HTML form with two submit buttons: "Save Draft" and "Publish"
    
    - The form is structured as follows:

        <form action="articleProcessor.php" method="POST">
            <label for="articleTitle">Title:</label>
            <input type="text" id="articleTitle" name="articleTitle" />
        
            <label for="articleContent">Content:</label>
            <textarea id="articleContent" name="articleContent"></textarea>
        
            <input type="submit" name="action" value="Save Draft" />
            <input type="submit" name="action" value="Publish" />
        </form>

    - In articleProcessor.php
        - How should you handle the form submission 
            - To differentiate between a draft save and a publish action?

    - Answer: 

        if ($_POST['action'] === 'Save Draft') {
            echo "Saved as draft";
        } else if ($_POST['action'] === 'Publish') {
            echo "Article Published";
        }

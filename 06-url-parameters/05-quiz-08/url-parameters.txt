Quiz 08: Test Your Knowledge About URL Parameters 
-------------------------------------------------
- You are developing a student portal for a university
    - Students can access various resources, including course materials and grades
    
    - Consider the URL
        
        http://studentportaluniversity.com/dashboard.php?view=grades&course=Physics

    - What will be the result of var_dump($_GET);?

    - Answer: 
        array(2) {
            ["view"] => string(6) "grades"
            ["course] => string(7) "Physics"
        }


- Imagine you are developing an online shopping website called 'Shopping Store Online'
    - The website uses URL parameters to pass information about products
    
    - Consider the following URL:

        http://shopping-store-online.com/product.php?id=7973&category=electronics&quantity=3

    - You should parse these parameters into variables 
        - $id, $category, and $quantity, then generate the following output:

            "There are 3 units of the product with ID 7973 in the electronics category available."

    - Which of the following code snippets correctly generates this output?

    - Answer: 
        $id = $_GET["id"];
        $category = $_GET["category"];
        $quantity = $_GET["quantity"];
        echo "There are $quantity units of the product with ID $id in the $category category available.";


- Imagine a travel booking website where users can search for hotels
    - After selecting options, the website generates the following URL:

        http://www.travel-site.com/hotels.php?location=New York&amenity=Bed & Breakfast&deal=Special & Offers

    - How many elements will the $_GET array contain when this URL is accessed?

    - Answer: 5


- Given the previous example where a travel booking website generated the following URL, leading to incorrect parsing:

    http://www.travel-site.com/hotels.php?location=New York&amenity=Bed & Breakfast&deal=Special & Offers

    - How can the http_build_query function be used to encode the URL parameters 
        - To prevent such parsing issues? Select the correct implementation:

    - Answer:
        $params = [
            'location' => 'New York',
            'amenity' => 'Bed & Breakfast',
            'deal' => 'Special & Offers'
        ];

        $query = http_build_query($params);
        $url = "http://www.travel-site.com/hotels.php?" . $query;

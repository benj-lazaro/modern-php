Submit A Form Through GET
-------------------------
- Another way of getting parameter(s) into a URL
    - Using the HTML element <form>
        - With the HTML attribute "method" set to "GET"

    - An HTML element <input> with
        - The HTML attribute "name" set to the paramter name
        
        - This accepts any text typed by a user
            - That will be assigned to the parameter name
            - Effectively creating a query string
            
    - Another HTML element <input> with
        - The HTML attribute "type" set to "submit"
            - And HTML attribute "value" set to "Submit!"
        
        - This create a form button labeled "Submit!"

        - NOTE: In order to repopulate the <input> element with
            - The previous data entered by a user
            
            - Assign the HTML attribute "value" with
                - The current element from the $_GET Associative array       

    - The query string is then sent to
        - The corresponding file
            - Based on the attribute "action"
            - Could be the same PHP file or another 

        - Via the HTTP method GET
            - Then key-value pair will be assigned to a $_GET Associative array

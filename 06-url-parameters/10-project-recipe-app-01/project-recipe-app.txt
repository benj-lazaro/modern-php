Project: Secure Recipe App (Introduction & Setup)
-------------------------------------------------
- A web app of recipes
    - It has a drop-down menu of 4 dishes
    
    - Selecting & clicking a dish
        - Loads the corresponding sub-page 
            - Stored in the pages/ directory

    - Use each page's HTML element <h1> content
        - As the label for the corresponding HTML element <option>
    
    - Use each page's filename
        - For the attribute "value" for each HTML element <option>

    - Use the PHP function "file_get_contents()"
        - To read the content of each sub-page

        - Return as a string content
            - Since each sub-page does NOT contain embedded PHP code
            - Instead of using an "include" statement
        
        - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.file-get-contents.php)
    
        - NOTE: Selecting the first option of the drop-down menu
            - Triggers a warning from the PHP interpreter
            - Since there is NO corresponding file to be opened

Dynamic URL Creation: Craft Links With Parameters & http_build_query 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- Crafting a hyperlink manually with a parameter (i.e. a query string)
    - Using the HTML element <a> and the corresponding attribute "src"
    
    - Works most of the time
        - Until the value of the parameter contains a "&" character
        
        - PHP interprets this character
            - The succeeding value after the "&"
                - Is a parameter
                - NOT part of the assigned value

            - Resulting to two parameters
                - The 1st parameter is assigned with NO value

                - The value prior ot the "&" character
                    - Becomes the 2nd parameter
                
                - The value after the "&" character
                    - Becomes the value to the 2nd parameter


- To address this
    - Instead of crafting a query string manually
        - Use PHP's function "http_build_query()" instead
    
    - This function generates a URL-encoded query string
        - From the Associative (or indexed) array provided

    - Uses the key-value pair from an Associative array or value from an indexed array
        - To generate the corresponding query string

        - Eliminates whitespace characters from the value
            - Replacing it with "+" character

        - Eliminates the "&" from the value
            - Prevents being misinterpreted as a start of a new parameter
            - Replacing it with "%26" character which translates the "&" as a symbol instead

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.http-build-query.php)

    - It also offers the ability
        - To support multiple paramters   

    - NOTE: This is considered best practice to use the function "http_build_query()"
        - For generating quert string (with paramters)

Submit A Form Through POST
--------------------------
- Another way of getting parameter(s) into a URL
    - Using the HTML element <form>
        - With the HTML attribute "method" set to the HTTP method "POST"

    - Rather than retrieving data from the Associative array $_GET 
        - It retrieves from the Associative array $_POST instead


- This method addresses problems when using the HTTP method "GET"
    - An HTML element <input>
        - With the attribute "type" set to "password"
        - The password value is displayed as plaintext in the URL

    - An HTML element <form>
        - WIth multiple HTML element <input>
        - NOT all user-type data can be transferred into the URL

    - Using the HTTP method "POST"
        - Multiple HTML element <input> of a form accepts user-provided data
            - BUT it will be NOT displayed as parameter(s) the URL

        - NOTE: It is NOT advisable to repopulate the <input> password field
            - As the value assigned in the HTML attribute "value" of an HTML element <input>
            - Is still displayed in cleartext
            - Use "https" to provide a layer of protection

Create Model Class
------------------
- Create a new folder "src"
    - This will ONLY contain files that contain Classes
        


- Inside the folder "src"
    - Create a Class file named "WorldCityModel.php"
        - NOTE: A Model represents a single entry (i.e. record) in the database

    - Inside the file "WorldCityModel.php"
        - Declare a Class name "WorldCityModel"
        - NOTE: It is best practice to name the filename that MATCHES the Class name
        
    - Create Properties based on the database column names
        - NOTE: EXCLUDE column names that has an "_" character

    
- Open the file "/inc/all.inc.php"
    - Require the file "WorldCityModel.php"


- Open the file "index.php"
    - Create mocked up models

    - Save each model into an array named "$entries"

    - Pass the "$entries" as an argument value to the function "render()"


- Open the file "/views/pages/index.view.php"
    - Render the content of the passed values from the variable "$entries"

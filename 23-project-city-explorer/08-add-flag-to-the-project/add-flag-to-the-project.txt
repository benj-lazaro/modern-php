Add Flag To The Project
-----------------------
- Takes the value from the column 'iso2' of each database record
    - Convert them into their corresponding flag using
    - PHP functions "mb_chr()" and "ord()"


- Move the created function "get_flag_for_country()"
    - From "index.php" into "/inc/functions.inc.php"


- In the file "/src/WorldCityModel.php"
    - Create a new Method named "getFlag()"
        - Expected to return a string

    - Simply calls the function "get_flag_for_country()"
        - Accepts the Property "$iso2" as argument value

    - Returns the returned of the function "get_flag_for_country()"
        - Which is a data type string


- Refactor the Method "getCityWithCountry()"
    - Embed the call to the Method "getFlag()" in the return statment

        return "{$this->city} ({$this->getFlag()} {$this->country})";
    

- In the file "/views/pages/city.view.php"
    - Add a new table row that renders the flag of the selected country

        <tr>
            <th>Flag of the country:</th>
            <td><?php echo e($city->getFlag()); ?></td>
        </tr>

Implement Pagination
--------------------
- Implement pagination on the web application as an exercise


- Create new Methods in the file "/src/WorldCityRepository.php"
    - A Method that accesses the database table `worldcities` and
        - Returns the number of entries in the database
    
    - A Method that based on the previous Method
        - Dictates the number of entries per page (i.e. pagination)


- On the file "index.php"
    - It accepts the page to load based on the given URL parameter

    - Render a simple pagination menu
        - At the bottom on the web application

Optimize The Code
-----------------
- Optimize the previous section's codebase structure


- In the file "/src/WorldCityRepository.php"
    - Presence of code repetition on the Methods "fetchById()" & "fetch()"
        - Fetched data from the database
        - Implement data into a new instantiated object of the Class "WorldCityModel"

    - NOTE: Repeating several lines of code multiple times is a sign to
        - Consolidate these lines of code into a single private Class Method 

    - Create a private Class Method named "arrayToModel()"
        - Accepts a parameter variable named "$entry" of data type array
        - Returns a "WorldCityModel" object

    - This Method serves as a helper function that
        - Implements fetched database record data
        - Into an instantiated object of the Class "WorldCityModel"

    - Replace the repeating lines of code
        - With a call to the private Class Method "arrayToModel()"


- In the file "/src/WorldCityModel.php"
    - Create a public Class Method named "getCityWithCountry()"
        - Accepts NO argument value
        - Returns a string

    - This Method serves as a helper function that 
        - Access the database record's 'city' and 'country' columns
        - Returns embedded data in a string

    - Update the corresponding view pages
        - "/views/pages/index.view.php"
        - "/views/pages/city.view.php"

    - Replace the line of code

        echo e($city->city); ?> (<?php echo e($city->country);

    - With a call to the method "getCityWithCountry()"

        echo e($city->getCityWithCountry());

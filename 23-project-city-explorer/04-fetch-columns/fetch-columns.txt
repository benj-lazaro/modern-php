Fetch Additional Columns 
------------------------
- Focuses on fetching the remaining columns from the database that was previously excluded
    - city_ascii
    - admin_name


- To fetch these columns without triggering a 'deprecation' notices from PHP
    - Open XAMPP's "php.ini" file
        - Located at "/opt/lampp/etc/php.ini"

    - Search for "error_reporting"
        - The current value "E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT" is ideal for production deployment

        - Change the value to "E_ALL"
            - Ideal for development
            - Renders deprecation notices

        - Save changes
            - Restart XAMPP's "Apache Web Server" service

        - To verify
            - Launch or relaunch PHP's info (phpinfo.php)
            - Search for "error_reporting"
            - The assigned value should change from "22527" to "32767"


    - Refactor the file "/src/WorldCityModel.php"
        - Declare a Constructor function

        - Migrate the Class Properties as parameter variables of the Constructor function

        - Include the additional columns
            - Use the proper naming convention for PHP 8
                - i.e. no "_" between words

        - Save changes



    - Refactor the file "/src/WorldCityRepostiry.php"
       - Declare and enable "Strict Typing"

            declare(strict_types=1);


        - Refactor the argument value for the PDO function "fetchAll()"
            - Change from "PDO::FETCH_CLASS, 'WorldCityModel'" to "PDO::FETCH_ASSOC"

        - Declare an empty array named "$models"
            - This will store each database entry as an instantiated "WorldCityModel" object

        - Declare a "foreach" loop
            - Iterate through the fetched database entries
            
            - Instantiate a new "WorldCityModel" object
                - Pass the column value of each database entry as argument values

            - Save each instantiated object into the array "$models"

            - NOTE: The value of each database entry's columns are IMPLICITLY coverted into a string
                - For non-string columns, EXPLICITLY type cast it to their corresponding data type 

        - Return the array "$models"

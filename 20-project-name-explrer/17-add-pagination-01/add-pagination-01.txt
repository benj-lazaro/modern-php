Add Pagination Part 01
----------------------
- Implement pagination feature


- Refactor the function "fetch_names_by_initial()"
    - To return a certain number of entries (i.e. names)
        - Located within the file "names.incn.php"

    - Add the following new parameters to the function
        - "$page"
            - Type "int" with a default value of 1
            - Representing a page of names

        - "$perPage"
            - Type "int" with a default value of 15
            - Represents number of names in a page

    - Refactor the SQL query statement
        - Add the keyword "LIMIT"
            - Assign the value of "$perPage"
            - Pair it with the placeholder ":limit"

        - Add the keyword "OFFSET"
            - Assign the value of "$page"
            - Pair it with the placeholder ":offset"

    - Bind the placeholders with their corresponding variables
        - Placeholder ":limit" with "$perPage"
            - With an additional parameter "PDO::PARAM_INT"
            - Informs PHP to expect a return value of int type

        - Placeholder ":offset" with "$perPage * ($page - 1)"
            - With an additional parameter "PDO::PARAM_INT"
            - Informs PHP to expect a return value of int type

    - Add input validation
        - To prevent a string value in "$page"
            - Force type casted into a int (i.e. 0)
            - Produce a negative int value
            - Triggers an "Uncaught PDOException: SQLSTATE[42000]"
    
        - Use the PHP function "max()"
            - Pass the value of 1 and current value of "$page" as argument values
            - Ensures that it will NEVER has a value of 0 or a negative int
            
    
- Refactor the file "char.php"
    - Add new argument "$page" to a call on the function "fetch_names_by_initial()"
    
    - Capture the value of the URL parameter 'page'
        - If empty, assign a default value of 1
        - Type cast value as int
        - Save into the variable "$page"

    - Declare a new variable "$perPage"
        - Assign the number of names to be rendered on a page
        - Initially assigned with the value of 15

    - On the call to the function "fetch_names_by_initial()"
        - Add the variable "$perPage" as an argument value


- In the file "names.inc.php"
    - Create a new function "count_names_by_initial()" that
        - Identifies the number of entries of a selected letter or initial

    - Accepts a string parameter named "$char"

    - Returns an int value of the column 'count'
    

- Back on the file "char.php"
    - Store the returned value by the function "count_names_by_initial()"
        - To the variable "$count"

    - On the call to the function "render()"
        - Add the following argument value 
        
        'pagination' => ['page' => $page, 'count' => $count, 'perPage' => $perPage]

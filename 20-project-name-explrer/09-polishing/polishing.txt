Polishing
---------
- Polishing the "index.php" UI
    - Initially renders ALL of the names in the main page


- To address this concern
    - Implement an "if" statement that checks
        - The length of the value from the URL parameter "char"
        
        - If the length is 0
            - Redirect it to a page that does NOT render a list of names
        
        - Then terminate the PHP script

    - Rename the current "index.php" to "char.php"
        - The page that renders a list of names when a letter is clicked

    - Update initial references to "index.php" into "char.php"
        - In the "header.php"

    - Create a new "index.php"
        - The page that does NOT render a list of names
        
        - NOTE: To be implemented in the next lecture

Fix A Bug
---------
- A bug in the function "fetch_names_by_initial()"
    - Specifically on the SQL statement's "LIKE" expression
        - Wherein it binds with "{$char}%"

    - The "%" character has a special meaning in SQL
        - It stands for ANY (allowed) character
    
    - Passing the "%" as value to the URL parameter "char"
        - It retrieves ALL of the names from the database
            - Renders them using the "char.view.php"

        - This is due to SQL intprets the query as "%%" meaning
            - It looks for names that starts with ANY character
            - Succeeding by ANY characters
            - Resulting to ALL records retrieved from the database

    
- NOTE: This is NOT a major security issue (i.e. SQL injection)
    - Nonetheless, the script had done something that is NOT intended
        
    - This incident highlights
        - The need to test the application
            - Have someone review the code

        - The value of placing (multiple) layered safeguards on the code
            - Implementing validation checks
                - When it fails, redirects user to the corresponding page
                - Then terminate the PHP script

            - Prevents a missed bug in becoming a major security issue

        - The value of using PDO's "prepare" statements


- To address this concern
    - Refactor "char.php"

    - Implement an additional input validation check
        - If the value of "$char" is NOT an alphabet character
        - Redirect user back to "index.php"
        - Then terminate the PHP script

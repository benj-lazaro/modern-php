DB Query In Function
--------------------
- Move the database query logic of "index.php"
    - Into its own separate function
        - Named as "fetch_names_by_initial()"
        - Requires a parameter that accepts an initial as input

    - Making the function callable
        - To different parts of the application's code


- When using the keyword "global"
    - Best AVOID using it within a function
    
    - EXCEPT for connecting to a database
        - Setting the PDO variable "$pdo" as "global"
        - It allows database connection into a function easily

    - NOTE: Alternatively making the PDO variable "$pdo"
        - As part of the function's parameter list
        
        - The developer may FORGET to include the variable "$pdo" 
            - As an argument value when calling the Function

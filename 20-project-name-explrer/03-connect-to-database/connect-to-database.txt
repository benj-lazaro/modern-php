Connect To Database
-------------------
- Connect the provided starter application to the database
    - The database connectivity "db-connect.inc.php" is
        - Called from the required file "all.inc.php"


- Refactor the content of "db-connect.inc.php"
    - Change the username 'root' to 'names'

    - Change the password '' to the generated password
        - During the creation of the username 'names'

    - Save the changes


- Test database connectivity
    - Prepare a SQL query in the file "db-connect.inc.php"
        - Query all records from the database
        - Fetch the 1st record to be rendered on the web page

    - Reload "index.php" in the browser
        - The 1st record is rendered on the web page


- Exploring user accounts related to database connectivity issues
    - On phpMyAdmin's "User accounts"
        - Displays a table of username, hostname, password & privilges that
            - Details access to the hosted databases

    - Accounts with identical usernames but different hostnames
        - Are considered different users

    - The hostname refers to where user are connectin from
        - Hostname of "%" refers to a connection from all IP addresses (i.e. anywhere)


- To "change" the privilges of an existing username
    - Click the tab "User accounts"

    - Click the checkbox of the targeted username

    - Click the link "Edit privilges"
        - Option to change "Login information"
        
        - Option to change privilges

        - Apply changes

    - NOTE: Privileges of the user does NOT get updated
        - Instead, it offers options to
            - Keep the old one
            - Delete the old one from the user tables
            - Revoke all active privielges from the old one & delete it afterwards
            - Delete the old one from the users tables & reload privielges afterwards

    - NOTE: Doing so, the application may lose
        - The ability to connect to its database


- A different way to connect to the MySQL database for Linux & MacOS
    - Is using a virtual file called "sockets"
        - NOTE: This is ideal for deployment, NOT during development
            - Due to an issues with XAMPP involving the hostname "%" 
            - NOT during development due to issues with XAMPP

    - PHP can use sockets to the MySQL database
        - This connectivity is highly efficient    
        
        - Allows PHP & MySQL to communicate without involing the network stack
        
        - NOTE: On Windows OS, the network stack likely involved
        
        - A socket is NOT an overhead since it is 
            - A "virtual file" that does NOT exists on the filesystem
            - Writing data into it, ends up saved in the MySQL database
    
        - The hostname "localhost" is a socket
        
        - NOTE: hostname "127.0.0.1" ALWAYS resolve to "localhost"
            - BUT it involves the network stack

        - The hostname "%" meant to involve the network stack
            - As it allows connectivity to the database from anywhere

            - NOTE: On the file "db-connect.inc.php"
                - Change the value of "host" from "localhost" to "127.0.0.1"
                - When the associated username account uses "%" as hostname
                - If it fails, change to the current PC's IP addresses

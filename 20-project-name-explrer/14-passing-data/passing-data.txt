Passing Data Into the render() Function
---------------------------------------
- One way of passing data into the function "render()"
    - Then having the data render on the corresponding file
        - The file that is responsible for generating an output

    - Add an Associative array on the parameter list of "render()"
        - Conventionally named "$params"
    
    - Iterate through the elements using a "foreach()" loop
        - Dynamically creating variables based on the 'key'
        - Assigning each with the corresponding 'value'

    - NOTE: A better approach is to use the PHP function "extract()"
        - Instead of using a "foreach()" loop


- The PHP function "extract()"
    - Acceps an argument value in the form an Associative array

    - It extract elemnts into individual variable(s) (w/ corresponding values)
        - Into PHP's symbol table in memory

    - The variable(s) is called directly inside
        - The file(s) responsible for generating output

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.extract.php)


- When calling the function "render()" 
    - 1st parameter = File being responsible on generating an output
    - 2nd parameter = Associative array whose value(s) to be passed to the file (1st param)

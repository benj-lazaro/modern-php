Output Buffering
----------------
- Output buffering allows to capture the output of a PHP script
    - And then be able to work with it
    - Before it is sent to the browser or shell

    - While active NO output is sent from the PHP script
        - Instead is tentatively stored in an internal buffer
    
    - Once the PHP script completes
        - The output is sent to the browser or shell
        - Content in the output buffer is implictly flushed

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/outcontrol.output-buffering.php)


- Without it, the output is sent to the browser or shell
    - In pieces as PHP processes through the script


- PHP provides a fully buffered user-level output
    - With functions to start, manipulate & stop
        - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.outcontrol.php)

    - As well as two (2) functions to flush system buffers
        - Function "flush()"
            - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.flush.php)

        - Function "ob_implicit_flush()"
            - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ob-implicit-flush.php)

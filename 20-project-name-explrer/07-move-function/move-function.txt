Move Function To A Separate File
--------------------------------
- Moving the function "fetch_names_by_initial()"
    - From "index.php" to its own separate file named "names.inc.php"

    - The file "names.inc.php" is intended to contain
        - Functions that works with the database "names"

    - Then require the file "names.inc.php" in "functions.inc.php"


- Enable strict typing on "names.inc.php"
    - To be implemented to ALL declared functions within this file


- Implement Type Annotations on the function "fetch_names_by_initial()"
    - Parameter list
    - Return value


- Alternatively, the logic in "index.php" that 
    - Checks the length of the URL parameter 'char'
        - Ensures that the 1st character is retrieve
        - Discards excess characters if any
        - Then uppercase the value

    - May be relocated as part of the function "fetch_names_by_initial()"

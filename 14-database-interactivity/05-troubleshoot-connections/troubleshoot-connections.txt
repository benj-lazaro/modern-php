Troubleshooting Database Connections With PDO
---------------------------------------------
- On both Linux & MacOS
    - PHP uses the following to connect to a database server
        - Local     = using "localhost" or 127.0.0.1
        - Remote    = using the database server's IPv4 address

    - Difference between "localhost" and 127.0.0.1
        - The former is a virtual file that
            - Does NOT send network packets to the database server
        
        - While the  latter does send network packets 


- On Windows OS
    - PHP uses the same connection methods to a database server

    - Except that the MySQL / MariaDB application 
        - Does NOT support sockets
        - It ALWAYS send network packets when accessing the database server


- IMPORTANT: When accessing a locally hosted database server
    - Use 127.0.0.1 for the "host" parameter instead of "localhost"
        

- The user account "root" may have been configured differently
    - When accessing a locally hosted database server using "localhost" and 127.0.0.1

    - In some cases, "root" may have access to one method but NOT BOTH
        - XAMPP has been configured the user account "root" to work on BOTH

    - NOTE: The first to check when accessing a locally hosted database server
        - Particularly when the user account "root" is used

    - NOTE: On other development platforms besides XAMPP
        - The user account "root" may have been assigned with a password
        
        - This is evident when flagged with the following error

            "Fatal error: Uncaught PDOException: ... access denied"

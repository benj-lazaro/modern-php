SQL Query Basics: Utilize ORDER BY Clause & SELECT Specific Columns 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fine tuning the SQL query statement
    - By default, data are sorted by Primary Key
    - Data can be sorted according to the column names of the table


- The SQL keyword "SELECT *" with the clause "FROM <database_table>"
    - Collect records from the specified database table
        - The "*" refers to ALL records
        - Mutiple specific column names can be selected; separated by a ,

    - The clause "ORDER BY <column_name>"
        - Sorts the records according to the selected column name

    - The clause "ASC" and "DESC" sorts the records in ascending / descending order
        - The "ASC"     = sort by ascending order
        - The "DESC"    = sort by descending order

    - NOTE: It is best practice to enclose the table & column names
        - Within a pair of backticks ` `
        - NOT a pair of single quotes ' '

        - This helps the SQL identify a keyword / clause
            - From an identical database / column name

    - NOTE: It is best practice to write SQL keywords & clauses in uppercase
        - For readability purposes

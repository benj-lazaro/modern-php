Database Connections With PDO: Initialization & Best Practices
--------------------------------------------------------------
- To connect a MySQL / MariaDB database from PHP
    - Requires using the PDO (PHP Data Objects) class
    
    - Offers a flexible and modern-way of accessing a SQL database

    - The instantiated object represents the database connection    

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.pdo.php)


- To establish a connection to a MySQL / MariaDB database
    - Instantiate the class PDO() to a variable "$pdo"
        - NOTE: It is considered best practice to use the variable name "$pdo"

    - Pass the following arguments to the class PDO()

    - The argument "mysql:host="
        - Identifies as a MySQL / MariaDB database connection

        - The ":host" part identifies as either a local or remote database
            - For local database, assign the value "localhost"

        - End with the ";" character as a separator

    - The arugment "dbname="
        - Identifies the name of the MySQL / MariaDB database to access
        - Followed by the ending " character
        - And then a "," 

        $foo = new PDO("mysql:host=<localhost_or_remote>; dbname=<db_name>", );

    - Next pass the username authorized to access the MySQL / MariaDB database
        - Enclosed in ""
        - Followed by a ","

    - Then the password of the said username
        - Also enclosed in ""
        - Followed by a ","

        $foo = new PDO("mysql:host=<localhost_or_remote>; dbname=<db_name>", "<username>", "<password>", );

    - Lastly, pass additional attributes that defines
        - How PHP should behave in the event that the connection failed
        
        - Attributes are enclosed within a pair of "[ ]"

            [PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE => PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION]

        - Informs PHP to flag a fatal error when the database connection fails

        $foo = new PDO("mysql:host=<localhost_or_remote>; dbname=<db_name>", '<user_name>', '<user_password>', [PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE => PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION]);


Syntax:

$foo = new PDO("mysql:host=<localhost_or_remote>; dbname=<db_name>", '<user_name>', '<user_password>', [PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE => PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION]);


Example:

$pdo = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost; dbname=note_app", 'root', '', [PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE => PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION]);

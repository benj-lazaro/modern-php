Strings Within Double Quotes: Utilize Variable Substitution & Special Characters
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Strings enclosed within a pair of " "
    - Allows more flexibility
        - Remove the need of using an escape character \ to include a ' in a string

    - Able to concatenate a variable & a string
        - Enclosed within a pair of " "
        - Without using the "." operator
    
        - NOTE: The preferred way of concatenating a variable with an additional string
            - Enclose the variable within a pair of { }
            - This helps PHP identify & separate the variable from the string
            - This is referred as "variable substitution"

    - Able to create (support) special Characters
        - Newline character = "\n"
        - Tab character     = "\t"


- Single quotes vs Double quotes
    - Use single quotes when
        - It is reasonably possible
        - Simply displaying a string value

    - Use double quotes when
        - Implementing a variable substitution in a string
        - Including a special character within a string

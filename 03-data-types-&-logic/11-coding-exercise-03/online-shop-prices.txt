Coding Exercise 03: Online Shop Prices
--------------------------------------
- A variable named "$price"
    - Declared in the background
    - Contains the original price of an item


- Your task is to manipulate the price according to the following:
    - Apply a 30% discount to the value in "$price"
    
    - Apply a flat discount of $10 to the price
        - After the first discount
        - A flat discount is a fixed amount subtracted from the price

    - Add a 20% tax to the price
        - After applying BOTH discounts

    - Calculate the loyalty points
        - Every cent spent earns 1 point
        - 100 points = $1 

    - Format the output as follows:

        "After applying discounts and taxes, the item's price is reduced from $150 to $114, and you've earned 11400 loyalty points."

Numbers
-------
- PHP has two number data types
    - Integer (int)
        - Whole numbers (both positive & negative)
        
        - Can be specified in
            - Decimal (base 10)
            - Hexadecimal (base 16)
            - Octal (base 8)
            - Binary (base 2)

        - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.integer.php)
        
    - Floating Point (float)
        - Number with a decimal point
        - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.float.php)


- PHP tries it's best to implicitly convert types automatically
    - When performing a mathematical operation between two number "strings"
        - Each number enclosed within a pair of ' '

    - This ONLY WORKS if BOTH operands
        - Can be converted into numbers
        - To perform the corresponding operation
        - Convert the returned result into a string

    - Otherwise, PHP flags a "fatal error"
        - Specifically an "Uncaught TypeError: Unsupported operand types..."
        - Chrome browser's JavaScript console reports a "500 (Internal Server Error)"


- The PHP function round()
    - Returns the rounded value (as a float) of a number passed as argument (1st argument)
        - To a specified precision (2nd optional argument, an integer)
        - As well as mode of round (3rd optional argument, a constant)

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.round.php)

Syntax:

round(<int | float> [,precision, mode])

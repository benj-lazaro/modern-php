The var_dump() Function: Inspect Variables
------------------------------------------
- The PHP function var_dump() dumps information about a variable
    - It sisplays information about
        - Data type of the value
        - Length (i.e. characters of a string)
        - Assigned value

        - NOTE: An emoji character & non-English character(s)
            - May consume more than 1 character to represent it in memory
                - e.g. an emoji = 4 characters
                - e.g. German language "Ã¤" = 2 characters
    
    - Arrays & objects are explored recursively with values

    - It is perfect for debugging
        - Offers more information than using an "echo" statement

    - There is NO value that is returned (i.e. void) by the var_dump()

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.var-dump.php)

Syntax:

var_dump(<expression>, [<expressions>]);

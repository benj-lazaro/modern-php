Boolean Operators: Craft More Complex Conditions
------------------------------------------------
- PHP's boolean (logical) operators
    - And (&&)  = true if BOTH operands are true
    - And (and) = true if BOTH operands are true
    - Or (||)   = true if EITHER operand is (or BOTH operands are) true
    - Or (or)   = true if EITHER operand is (or BOTH operands are) true
    - Not (!)   = true if operand is NOT true
    - Xor (xor) = true if EITHER operand but NOT BOTH

    - NOTE: The variants "and" & "or" operate at different predences

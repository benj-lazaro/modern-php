Project: Restaurant Website Refinement (Exercise Intoduction)
-------------------------------------------------------------
- Further improve the Restaurant project from the previous chapter
    - Improvements to be implemented as an Exercise


- Refinement tasks:
    - Navigation bar
        - Highlights the menu button based on the active (loaded) page

        - Each page has added a new variable "$pageKey"
            - This helps identify which page is currently active
            
            - Dynamically add the CSS class "active" 
                - To the corresponding HTML element <a>

    - Default header background image
        - A default (fallback) background image for the header
            - When a new page is created / added into the website 

        - Current implementation
            - Each page has its own dedicated header background image
        
    - Default HTML <title> element
        - Loads a default (fallback) HTML element <title>
            - When a new page forgets to include one
            
    - Target file: header.inc.php

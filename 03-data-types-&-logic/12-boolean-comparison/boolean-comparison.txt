Boolean & Comparison Operators: Compare Values
----------------------------------------------
- PHP comparison operators
    - ==    = Equal                     Returns true if BOTH operands are equal in value
    - ===   = Identical                 Returns true if BOTH operands are equal in value AND data type
    - !=    = Not equal                 Returns true if BOTH operands are NOT equal in value
    - <>    = Not equal                 Returns true if BOTH operands are NOT equal in value
    - !==   - Not identical             Returns true if BOTH operands are NOT equal in value OR data type
    - <     = Less than                 Returns true if the 1st operand is less than the 2nd operand
    - >     = Greater than              Returns true if the 1st operand is greater than the 2nd operand
    - <=    = Less than or equal to     Returns true if the 1st operand is greater than or equal to the 2nd operand

    - NOTE: For equality checks
        - It is recommended to use "===" and "!==" operators

Coding Exercise 04: Loyalty Points Evaluation Part 01
-----------------------------------------------------
- A variable named "$loyaltyPoints"
    - Holds a customer's loyalty points balance


- Your task is to assess the "$loyaltyPoints" of a customer
    - Output a corresponding message based on their balance

    - less than 3000 points = no discount
    - 3000 or more points   = 5% discount
    - 6000 or more points   = 15% discount

    - Corresponding text message is as follows:

        "You have fewer than 3000 Loyalty Points. No discount is available."

        "You can spend <3000 | 6000> Loyalty Points for a discount of <5 | 15>%."

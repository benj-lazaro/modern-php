Coding Exercise 04: Loyalty Points Evaluation Part 02
-----------------------------------------------------
- Determine the customer's discount
    - Based on their Loyalty Points balance
        - Less than 3000 points     = no discount
        - 3000 or more points       = 5% discount
        - 6000 or more points       = 15% discount


- Calculate discounted total
    - Compute the total amount after applying the eligible discount
    - Customers with over 6000 points should be considered for both discount options


- Apply tax
    - Add 8% tax to the discounted total

- Update Loyalty Points
    - Calculate the customer's new Loyalty Points balance
    
    - Every cent spent (after tax) earns 1 Loyalty Point ($1 = 100 Loyalty Points)
    
    - Subtract the spent Loyalty Points for the discount
        - Then add points based on the final purchase amount


- Display checkout message
    - Display a tailored message for the customer

The '^' And '$' Anchors: Define String Boundaries
-------------------------------------------------
- These are two important symbols in regular expression 
    - The '^' refers to the start position of the string
    - The '$' refers to the end position of the string


Example:

/^H/    = matches all "H" characters that are at the beginning of a string


- The character '.' in a regular expression
    - It refers to ANY character


- NOTE: Regular expression can only perform 90-95% validation
    - NEVER completely make SURE that EVERYTHING MATCHES

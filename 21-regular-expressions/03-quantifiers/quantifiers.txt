Quantifiers: Control Repetitions For Powerful Pattern Matching
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Allows to specify how often a character or character class 
    - In front of the it should be repeated


- Quantifiers that can be used
    - *     = repeated 0 to any number of times
    - +     = repeated 1 to any number of times
    - ?     = repeated character (or character class) 0 or 1 time (optional)
    - {n}   = repeated exactly at <n> times
    - {n,}  = repeated at least <n> times
    - {n,m} = repeated from <n> tp <m> times

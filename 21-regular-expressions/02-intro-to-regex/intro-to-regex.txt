Intro To Regex: Search Patterns In Strings
------------------------------------------
- Using Regex to check if a target string pattern exists w/in a string
    - The PHP function "preg_match()"
        - 1st parameter = regex expression enclosed w/in /<regex>/ 
        - 2nd parameter = input string
        - 3rd parameter = an array with results of search

        - It returns
            - An int value of 1 = match found
            - An int value of 0 = NO match found
            - A boolean "false" = search failed

        - NOTE: It ONLY finds the 1st matching instance
            - To search for all matching instances
            - Use the PHP function "preg_match_all()"

- Regular expression uses Character classes
    - A character class matches a single charcter in the input string

    - However, character types (see below) are commonly used with Regex
        - Each type has a specific meaning

        \d     any decimal digit from 0 to 9
        \D     any character that is not a decimal digit (includes whitespace)
        \h     any horizontal white space character
        \H     any character that is not a horizontal white space character
        \s     any white space character
        \S     any character that is not a white space character
        \v     any vertical white space character
        \V     any character that is not a vertical white space character
        \w     any "word" character (ignores whitespace charcter)
        \W     any "non-word" character

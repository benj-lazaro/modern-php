Overview
--------
- This section focuses on
    - Regular expression also referred as regex (in short)

    - How regex helps 
        - Evaluate the contents of a string
        - Find sub-string(s) within a string

    - PHP offers several function that work with regex
        - preg_match()
            - Checks if a string matches a regular expression
            - e.g. checking for an email address or phone number pattern

        - preg_replace()
            - It is like the function "str_replace()"
                - Replaces a sub-string with another
                - BUT uses a regular expression

    - NOTE: This is NOT mandatory
        - PHP code can be written without the need to know regex
